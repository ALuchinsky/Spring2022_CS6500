The fitting formula for the sea level muon spectrum at different zenith angles for spherical atmosphere is proposed. The concrete calculations for pure water are presented.

Parametrizations of all continuous energy losses are obtained with using the most recent expressions for muon interaction cross-sections.

{"title":"Kaon physics with light sgoldstinos and parity conservation","abstract":"Superpartners of goldstino -- scalar and pseudoscalar sgoldstinos -- interact weakly with ordinary particles. One or both of them may be light. We consider a class of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model in which interactions of sgoldstinos with quarks and gluons conserve parity but do not conserve quark flavor. If the pseudoscalar sgoldstino $P$ is light, m_P<(m_K-2m_\\pi), and the scalar sgoldstino is heavier, m_S>(m_K-m_\\pi), an interesting place for experimental searches is the poorly explored area of three-body decays of kaons, K^0_{S,L}\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- P, K^0_{S,L}\\to\\pi^0\\pi^0 P and K^+\\to\\pi^+\\pi^0 P, with $P$ subsequently decaying into \\gamma\\gamma, possibly e^+e^-, or flying away from the detector. We evaluate the constraints on the flavor-violating coupling of sgoldstino to quarks which are imposed by K^0_L-K^0_S mass difference and CP-violation in neutral kaon system, and find that these constraints allow for fairly large Br(K\\to\\pi\\pi P).

Within the considered paramter space, we find the following. (a) In models I and II, the new physics corrections are always small in size and will be masked by other larger known theoretical uncertainties. (b) In model III, the new physics corrections to the branching ratios of those QCD penguin-dominated decays $\\ov B_s \\to K^0\\etapp, K^+ K^{-*}, etc.$, are large in size and insensitive to the variations of $\\mhp$ and $\\nceff$.

{"title":"Charge asymmetry of pions in the process e+ e- ---> e- e+ pi+ pi-","abstract":"The study of the charge asymmetry of produced particles allows to investigate the interference of different production mechanisms and to determine new features of the corresponding amplitudes. In the process $e^- e^+ \\to e^- e^+ \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ the two-pion system is produced via two mechanisms: two-photon (C-even state) and bremsstrahlung (C-odd state) production. We study the charge asymmetry of pions in a differential in the pion momenta cross section originating from an interference between these two mechanisms. At low effective mass of dipions this asymmetry is directly related to the s- and p-phases of elastic $\\pi\\pi$ scattering.

The investigation is performed in the lowest non-vanishing order of the perturbation theory using the existing restrictions on the 2HDM parameters space. It is shown that the direct CP-asymmetry in the $B \\to X_d \\gamma$ decay can deviate significantly from the Standard Model predictions. In the presence of only one source of CP-violation (the CKM matrix weak phase) $a_{CP}(B \\to X_d \\gamma)$ can have the sign opposite to that in the SM. The new source of CP-violation can make $|a_{CP}(B \\to X_d \\gamma)|$ arbitrary small (unlike the SM case) and hence unmeasurable. Quantitatively, the obtained results suffer from the uncertainty of the choice of renormalization scale. As for the $B \\to X_d e^+ e^ - $ rate asymmetry, its renormalization scale dependence in the lowest non-vanishing order does not allow to conclude if this quantity is efficient for testing New Physics beyond the Standard Model.","created":"2000-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":16,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: rare decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: electromagnetic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"doublet: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B --> photon anything"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B --> electron positron anything"}],"num_refs":66,"citation_count":20,"authors":["Asatryan, H.H.","Asatrian, H.M.","Yeghiyan, G.K.","Savvidy, G.K."]}

In contrast to RS, we imagine that we are living on the positive tension Planck brane, or on a zero-tension TeV brane. In our model there are two solutions for the scalar field in the bulk and the corresponding brane separations, one of which is tuned to have zero cosmological constant. We show that in the other solution, which is a false vacuum state, the 4-D cosmological constant can be naturally small, due to exponential suppression by the warp factor. The radion is in the milli-eV mass range, and if we live on a TeV brane its couplings are large enough that it can measurably alter the gravitational force at submillimeter distances. In this case the Kaluza-Klein excitations of the graviton can also contribute to submillimeter deviations from Newtonian gravity, and we have in addition the collider phenomenology of the usual TeV-scale radion.","created":"2000-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"superpotential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radion"}],"num_refs":46,"citation_count":22,"authors":["Cline, James M.","Firouzjahi, Hassan"]}

If this is the case, some mechanism must be present to adequately suppress operators that violate baryon number. Here we explore the possibility that the desired suppression is a consequence of an additional, spontaneously-broken, non-anomalous U(1) symmetry that is orthogonal to hypercharge. We show that successful models can be constructed in which the additional particle content necessary to cancel anomalies is minimal, and compatible with the constraints from precision electroweak measurements and gauge unification. If unification is sacrificed, and only the new U(1) and its associated Higgs fields live in the bulk, it is possible that the gauge field zero mode and first few Kaluza-Klein excitations lie within the kinematic reach of the Tevatron. For gauge couplings not much smaller than that of hypercharge, we show that these highly leptophobic states could evade detection at Run I, but be discovered at Run II.

These \"universal\" extra dimensions could have a compactification scale as low as 300 GeV for one extra dimension. This is because the Kaluza-Klein number is conserved and thus the contributions to the electroweak observables arise only from loops. The main constraint comes from weak-isospin violation effects. We also compute the contributions to the S parameter and the $Zb\\bar{b}$ vertex. The direct bound on the compactification scale is set by CDF and D0 in the few hundred GeV range, and the Run II of the Tevatron will either discover extra dimensions or else it could significantly raise the bound on the compactification scale. In the case of two universal extra dimensions, the current lower bound on the compactification scale depends logarithmically on the ultra-violet cutoff of the higher dimensional theory, but can be estimated to lie between 400 and 800 GeV.

Moreover, the inferred value of $\\Ee$ is already in the SMA case lower than those found in simulations. This apparent conflict has been interpreted as evidence against the large mixing oscillation solutions to the solar neutrino problem. In order to quantify the degree to which the experimental data favour the SMA over the large mixing solutions we use their likelihood ratios as well as a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We find within the range of SN parameters predicted by simulations regions in which the LMA-MSW solution is either only marginally disfavoured or favoured compared to the SMA-MSW solution. We conclude therefore that the LMA-MSW solution is not in conflict with the current understanding of SN physics. In contrast, the vacuum oscillation and the LOW solutions to the solar neutrino problem can be excluded at the $4\\sigma$ level for most of the SN parameter ranges found in simulations.

The success of the hydrodynamic model points to very rapid thermalization in Au+Au collisions at RHIC and provides a serious challenge for kinetic approaches based on classical scattering of on-shell particles.","created":"2000-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"25.75.-q"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"24.85.+p"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"25.75.Ld"},{"source":"author","value":"Relativistic heavy-ion collisions"},{"source":"author","value":"Elliptic flow"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lead"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: particle flow"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: particle flow"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charged particle: particle flow"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transport theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hydrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rapidity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CERN SPS"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Brookhaven RHIC Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":49,"citation_count":472,"authors":["Kolb, P.F.","Huovinen, P.","Heinz, Ulrich W.","Heiselberg, H."]}

The approach is based on the contracted O(8) symmetry recently shown to emerge from QCD for these states in the combined large N_c and heavy quark limits. The effective theory is based on perturbations about this limit; a power counting scheme is developed in which the small parameter is lambda^{1/2} where lambda ~ 1/N_c, Lambda /m_Q (with Lambda being a typical strong interaction scale). We derive the effective Hamiltonian for strong interactions at next-to-leading order. The next-to-leading order effective Hamiltonian depends on only two parameters beyond the known masses of the nucleon and heavy meson.

Tachyonic preheating is so efficient that symmetry breaking typically completes within a single oscillation of the field distribution as it rolls towards the minimum of its effective potential. As an application of this theory we consider preheating in the hybrid inflation scenario, including SUSY-motivated F-term and D-term inflationary models. We show that preheating in hybrid inflation is typically tachyonic and the stage of oscillations of a homogeneous component of the scalar fields driving inflation ends after a single oscillation. Our results may also be relevant for the theory of the formation of disoriented chiral condensates in heavy ion collisions.","created":"2000-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"phi**n model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tachyon: preheating"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation: hybrid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":36,"citation_count":465,"authors":["Felder, Gary N.","Garcia-Bellido, Juan","Greene, Patrick B.","Kofman, Lev","Linde, Andrei D.","Tkachev, Igor"]}

{"title":"Gauge bosons in an SU(2)-(right) x SU(2)-(left) x G(lepton) electroweak model","abstract":"By considering its generalization to composite J=0 mesons proposed in a previous work [1], I show how and why a chiral extension of the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg standard model of electroweak interactions calls, there, for right-handed charged W_R's coupled with g_R = e/cos(theta_W), and the masses of which are related to the ones of the left-handed W_L's through the relation M_L^2 + M_R^2 = M_Z^2. The mesonic sector, having vanishing baryonic and leptonic number, is neutral with respect to the corresponding U(1) symmetries, making the natural chiral gauge group to be [SU(2)left x SU(2)right], blind to the presence of extra Z's. The W_R gauge bosons cannot have been detected in hadronic colliders and can be very elusive in electroweak processes involving, in particular, pseudoscalar mesons. Present data select one among two possible extensions for which, in the right sector: - a specific breaking of universality occurs between families of quarks, which belong to inequivalent representations of SU(2)right; - the mixing angle is a free parameter, constrained to be smaller than the Cabibbo angle by the box diagrams controlling the K_L-K_S mass difference; this also minimizes contributions to muon -> electron + photon.

{"title":"Resummation of Yukawa enhanced and subleading Sudakov logarithms in longitudinal gauge boson and Higgs production","abstract":"Future colliders will probe the electroweak theory at energies much larger than the gauge boson masses. Large double (DL) and single (SL) logarithmic virtual electroweak Sudakov corrections lead to significant effects for observable cross sections. Recently, leading and subleading universal corrections for external fermions and transverse gauge boson lines were resummed by employing the infrared evolution equation method. The results were confirmed at the DL level by explicit two loop calculations with the physical Standard Model (SM) fields. Also for longitudinal degrees of freedom the approach was utilized for DL-corrections via the Goldstone boson equivalence theorem. In all cases, the electroweak Sudakov logarithms exponentiate. In this paper we extend the same approach to both Yukawa enhanced as well as subleading Sudakov corrections to longitudinal gauge boson and Higgs production. We use virtual contributions to splitting functions of the appropriate Goldstone bosons in the high energy regime and find that all universal subleading terms exponentiate. The approach is verified by employing a non-Abelian version of Gribov's factorization theorem and by explicit comparison with existing one loop calculations. As a side result, we obtain also all top-Yukawa enhanced subleading logarithms for chiral fermion production at high energies to all orders. In all cases, the size of the subleading contributions at the two loop level is non-negligible in the context of precision measurements at future linear colliders.","created":"2000-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":32,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: Sudakov"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Goldstone particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"equivalence theorem"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bremsstrahlung"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"factorization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"DGLAP equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"proposed experiment"}],"num_refs":52,"citation_count":57,"authors":["Melles, Michael"]}

Previously, calculations have been done to bound the size of these extra dimensions in the case when the metric was factorizable. Here we consider the case of 2 `weakly warped' extra dimensions. We find that even though weak warping seems only to affect the zero mode this can have a measurable effect on the supernovae bounds. In any braneworld model such warping is necessarily present and as such should be taken into account in supernovae bounds and in searches for corrections to Newtonian gravity.","created":"2000-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":9,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supernova"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 6"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"graviton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"zero mode"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"compactification"}],"num_refs":11,"citation_count":8,"authors":["Fox, Patrick J."]}

Fully polarized e- or e+ beams could produce the stop two times as much as unpolarized beams, while they increase background events due to the process of the standard model by about 30% in comparison with unpolarized ones. We show that right-handed e+ beams at HERA is efficient to produce the stop in the model. With 1 fb**(-1) of integrated luminosity we estimate reach in the coupling constant lambda'(131) for masses of the stop in the range 160-400 GeV. We can set a 95% confidence-level exclusion limit for lambda'(131) > 0.01-0.05 in the stop mass range of 240-280 GeV if no singal of the stop is observed.

In the linear scenario we find that these couplings can be generated only by dimension eight operators necessarily including the Higgs boson field, whereas in the nonlinear case they are induced by dimension six operators. We consider the impact of these couplings on some precision measurements such as the magnetic and electric dipole moments of fermions, as well as the Z boson rare decay Z -> neutrino+antineutrino+ photon. If the underlying new physics is of a decoupling nature, it is not expected that trilinear neutral gauge boson couplings may affect considerably any of these observables.

{"title":"Probing slepton mass nonuniversality at e+ e- linear colliders","abstract":"There are many models with non-universal soft SUSY breaking sfermion mass parameters at the grand unification scale. Even in the mSUGRA model scalar mass unification might occur at a scale closer to M_Planck, and renormalization effects would cause a mass splitting at M_GUT. We identify an experimentally measurable quantity Delta that correlates strongly with delta m^2 = m^2_{selectron_R}(M_GUT) - m^2_{selectron_L}(M_GUT), and which can be measured at electron-positron colliders provided both selectrons and the chargino are kinematically accessible. We show that if these sparticle masses can be measured with a precision of 1% at a 500 GeV linear collider, the resulting precision in the determination of Delta may allow experiments to distinguish between scalar mass unification at the GUT scale from the corresponding unification at Q ~ M_Planck. Experimental determination of Delta would also provide a distinction between the mSUGRA model and the recently proposed gaugino-mediation model. Moreover, a measurement of Delta (or a related quantity Delta') would allow for a direct determination of delta m^2.","created":"2000-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"slepton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"chargino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"selectron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"universality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supergravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":24,"citation_count":22,"authors":["Baer, Howard","Balazs, Csaba","Hesselbach, Stefan","Mizukoshi, J.Kenichi","Tata, Xerxes"]}

We find general static solutions to the metric which require the fine-tuning of the inter-brane distance and the bulk cosmological constant (leaving the two brane tensions as free parameters) corresponding to a vanishing effective cosmological constant and a constant radion field. Taking these solutions as a background configuration, we perform a dimensional reduction and study the effective theory in the case of one- and two-brane configurations. We show that the radion field can have a positive mass squared, which corresponds to a stabilization of the extra dimension, only for a repulsive nature of the Casimir force. This type of solution requires the presence of a negative tension brane. The solutions with one or two positive tension branes arising in this theory turn out to have negative radion mass squared, and therefore are not stable.","created":"2000-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"force: Casimir"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: conformal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimensional reduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Einstein equation: solution"}],"num_refs":60,"citation_count":88,"authors":["Hofmann, Ralf","Kanti, Panagiota","Pospelov, Maxim"]}

A novel method to find this phase from simple measurements of lifetimes and branching ratios in untagged decays is proposed.

For the tagged decays, an outstanding role is played by the observables of the time-dependent angular distribution of the B_s -> J/psi [-> l^+ l^-] \\phi [-> K^+K^-] decay products.

{"title":"Investigation of meson loop effects in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model","abstract":"The influence of mesonic fluctuations on quantities in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is examined in different approximation schemes: an expansion in powers of 1/N_c and an expansion up to one-meson loop in the effective action formalism. It is explicitely proved that the Goldstone theorem as well as the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation hold within those schemes. The influence of meson-loop effects on the quark condensate, the pion mass, the pion decay constant and properties of rho- and sigma-meson are investigated. First we focus on the determination of a consistent set of parameters. In the 1/N_c expansion scheme it is possible to find a set of parameters which allows to simultaneously describe the quantities in the pion sector and those related to the rho-meson, whereas this turns out to be not possible within the expansion of the effective action. Besides, the relation of our model to hadronic models is discussed. In the last part of this thesis the behavior of the quark condensate at nonzero temperature is studied. In the low-temperature region agreement with the model independent chiral perturbation theory result in lowest order can be obtained. The perturbative 1/N_c expansion scheme does not allow for an examination of the chiral phase transition at higher temperatures, whereas this is possible within the meson-loop approximation scheme. A first order phase transition is found.","created":"2000-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":126,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Jona-Lasinio-Nambu model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Hartree-Fock approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"random phase approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N: color"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rho(770): polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature: 0"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"regularization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: gap"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"f0(600)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":100,"citation_count":17,"authors":["Oertel, Micaela"]}

Each scenario relies on supersymmetric loop effects alone, without modifying the naive Yukawa unification. First, we consider A-terms that follow the usual proportionality condition. In this case SUSY effects can improve the mass relations, but not completely. Interestingly, imposing Yukawa coupling unification for two families greatly constrains the range of parameters in the MSSM. Secondly, we employ a new ansatz for the tri-linear A-terms that satisfies all experimental and vacuum stability bounds, and can successfully modify the mass relations. Finally, we investigate the use of general (non-proportional) A-terms, with large off-diagonal entries. In this case flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) data present an important constraint. We do not pretend to present a complete, motivated theory of fermion masses.

{"title":"Unitarized pseudoscalar meson scattering amplitudes in three flavor linear sigma models","abstract":"The three flavor linear sigma model is studied as a ``toy model'' for understanding the role of possible light scalar mesons in the \\pi \\pi, \\pi K and \\pi \\eta scattering channels. The approach involves computing the tree level partial wave amplitude for each channel and unitarizing by a simple K-matrix prescription which does not introduce any new parameters. If the renormalizable version of the model is used there is only one free parameter. While this highly constrained version has the right general structure to explain \\pi \\pi scatteirng, it is ``not quite'' right. A reasonable fit can be made if the renormalizability (for the {\\it effective} Lagrangian) is relaxed while chiral symmetry is maintained. The occurence of a Ramsauer Townsend mechanism for the f_0(980) region naturally emerges. The effect of unitarization is very important and leads to ``physical'' masses for the scalar nonet all less than about 1 GeV.

{"title":"Radiative decay of a massive particle and the nonthermal process in primordial nucleosynthesis","abstract":"We consider the effects on big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) of the radiative decay of a long-lived massive particle. If high-energy photons are emitted after the BBN epoch ($t \\sim 1 - 10^3$ sec), they may change the abundances of the light elements through photodissociation processes, which may result in a significant discrepancy between standard BBN and observation. Taking into account recent observational and theoretical developments in this field, we revise our previous study constraining the abundance of the radiatively-decaying particles. In particular, on the theoretical side, it was recently claimed that the non-thermal production of $^6$Li, which is caused by the photodissociation of $\\hefour$, most severely constrains the abundance of the radiatively-decaying particle. We will see, however, it is premature to emphasize the importance of the non-thermal production of $^6$Li because (i) the theoretical computation of the $^6$Li abundance has large uncertainty due to the lack of the precise understanding of the $^6$Li production cross section, and (ii) the observational data of $^6$Li abundance has large errors.","created":"2000-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light nucleus: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lithium: photofission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lithium: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: massive"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":52,"citation_count":140,"authors":["Kawasaki, Masahiro","Kohri, Kazunori","Moroi, Takeo"]}

{"title":"Analytic perturbation theory for QCD observables","abstract":"The connection between ghost-free formulations of RG-invariant perturbation theory in the both Euclidean and Minkowskian regions is studied. Our basic tool is the \"double spectral representation\", similar to definition of Adler function, that stems from first principles of local QFT. It relates real functions defined in the Euclidean and Minkowskian regions. On this base we establish a simple relation between -- The trick of resummation of the $\\pi^2$-terms (known from early 80s) for the invariant QCD coupling and observables in the time-like region and -- Invariant Analytic Approach (devised a few years ago) with the \"analyticized\" coupling $\\alpha_{\\rm an}(Q^2)$ and nonpower perturbative expansion for observables in the space-like domain which are free of unphysical singularities . As a result, we formulate a self-consistent scheme, Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT), that relates a renorm-invariant, effective coupling functions $\\alpha_{an}(Q^2) $ and $\\tilda{alpha}(s),$ as well as non-power perturbation expansions for observables in both space- and time-like domains, that are free of extra singularities and obey better convergence in the infrared region.

{"title":"Is there still a strong CP problem?","abstract":"The role of a chiral U(1) phase in the quark mass in QCD is analysed from first principles. In operator formulation, there is a parity symmetry and the phase can be removed by a change in the representation of the Dirac gamma matrices. Moreover, these properties are also realized in a Pauli-Villars regularized version of the theory. In the functional integral scenario, attempts to remove the chiral phase by a chiral transformation are thought to be obstructed by a nontrivial Jacobian arising from the fermion measure and the chiral phase may therefore seem to break parity. But if one starts from the regularized action with the chiral phase also present in the regulator mass term, the Jacobian for a combined chiral rotation of quarks and regulators is seen to be trivial and the phase can be removed by a combined chiral rotation. This amounts to a taming of the strong CP problem.","created":"2000-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":3,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"}],"num_refs":12,"citation_count":30,"authors":["Banerjee, H.","Chatterjee, D.","Mitra, P."]}

{"title":"String models of glueballs and the spectrum of SU(N) gauge theories in (2+1)-dimensions","abstract":"The spectrum of glueballs in 2+1 dimensions is calculated within an extended class of Isgur-Paton flux tube models and is compared to lattice calculations of the low-lying SU(N) glueball mass spectra. Our modifications of the model include a string curvature term and different ways of dealing with the flux tube width. We find that the generic model is remarkably successful at reproducing the positive charge conjugation, C=+, sector of the spectrum. The only large (and robust) discrepancy involves the 0-+ state. This raises the interesting possibility that the lattice spin identification is mistaken and that this state is in fact 4-+. In addition, the Isgur-Paton model does not incorporate any mechanism for splitting C=+ from C=- (in contrast to the case in 3+1 dimensions), while the `observed' spectrum shows a substantial splitting. We explore several modifications of the model in an attempt to incorporate this physics in a natural way. At the qualitative level we find that this constrains our choice to a picture in which the C=+/- splitting is driven by mixing with new states built on closed loops of adjoint flux. However a detailed numerical comparison suggests that a model incorporating an additional direct mixing between loops of opposite orientation is likely to work better: and that, in any case, a non-zero curvature term will be required. We also point out that a characteristic of any string model of glueballs is that the SU(N=infinity) mass spectrum will consist of multiple towers of states that are scaled up copies of each other. To test this will require a lattice mass spectrum that extends to somewhat larger masses than currently available.","created":"2000-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":41,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Gc"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.15.Kc"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.39.Mk"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(N)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glueball: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flux tube"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":39,"authors":["Johnson, Robert W.","Teper, Michael J."]}

We analyze the scaling of the leptonic dipole moments with the lepton masses in theories beyond the standard model. While in many models the dipole moments scale roughly as lepton mass, it is shown that simple models exist in which the dipoles scale as the cube of the mass or in other ways. An explicit example with cubic scaling is presented, which is motivated on independent grounds from large angle neutrino oscillation data.

To assess the viability of the spontaneous CP violation scenario, we estimate epsilon_K by applying the mass insertion approximation. We find that a non-trivial flavour structure in the soft-breaking A terms is required to account for the observed CP violation in the neutral kaon sector. Furthermore, combining the minimisation conditions for spontaneous CP violation with the constraints coming from K0-K0bar mixing, we find that the upper bound on the lightest Higgs-boson mass becomes stronger.

The magnitude of the asymmetry is predicted to be larger than that by the standard model in wide parameter regions where the branching ratio is consistent with its experimental bounds. A possible maximal magnitude is about 0.1, which will be well accessible at B factories.","created":"2000-12-26T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Durham 2000/09/17"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-B: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"width: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supergravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B --> photon anything"}],"num_refs":12,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Aoki, Mayumi"]}

We predict fixed properties of the extra Z' boson, as well as the new lepton doublets X and X^c, and the observation of diquark resonances at hadron colliders in this scenario.","created":"2000-12-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: E(6)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: diquark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z': width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: postulated particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: doublet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"}],"num_refs":31,"citation_count":23,"authors":["Ma, Ernest","Raidal, Martti"]}

The method arises naturally on discretisation of the Bjorken x variable, a necessary procedure for numerical integration. Owing to peculiar properties of the matrices involved, the resulting equations take on a particularly simple form and may be solved in closed analytical form in the variable t=ln(alpha_0/alpha). Such an approach affords parametrisation via data x bins, rather than fixed functional forms. Thus, with the aid of the full correlation matrix, appraisal of the behaviour in different x regions is rendered more transparent and free of pollution from unphysical cross-correlations inherent to functional parametrisations. Computationally, the entire programme results in greater speed and stability; the matrix representation developed is extremely compact. Moreover, since the parameter dependence is linear, fitting is very stable and may be performed analytically in a single pass over the data values.","created":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"DGLAP equation: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"DGLAP equation: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parametrization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mathematical methods"}],"num_refs":9,"citation_count":34,"authors":["Ratcliffe, Philip G."]}

In particular, we present a supersymmetry-breaking mechanism which has a geometrical origin, and consists of imposing different boundary conditions between the fermions and bosons living in the 5d bulk. The scale of supersymmetry breaking is exponentially small due to the warp factor of the AdS metric. We apply this mechanism to a supersymmetric standard model where supersymmetry breaking is transmitted through the AdS bulk to matter fields confined on the Planck-brane. This leads to a predictable superparticle mass spectrum where the gravitino mass is $10^{-3}$eV and scalar particles receive masses at the one-loop level via bulk gauge interactions.

While $\\mu_i^*\\lambda^{\\prime}_{i11}$ could bear a complex phase, the latter is not necessary to have a R-parity violating contribution.","created":"2001-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":43,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":35,"citation_count":31,"authors":["Keum, Y.Y.","Kong, Otto C.W."]}

{"title":"Lepton flavor violation with nonuniversal soft terms","abstract":"We study the lepton-flavor violation processes tau ->mu gamma and mu->e gamma in two different examples of models with non-universal soft breaking terms derived from strings. We show that the predictions are quite different from those of universal scenarios. Non-universal A-terms provide an interesting framework to enhance the supersymmetric contributions to CP violation effects. We observe that in the case of the lepton-flavor violation we study, the non-universality of the scalar masses enhances the branching ratios more significantly than the non-universality of the A-terms. We find that the current experimental bounds on these processes restrict both the parameter space of the models and the texture of the Yukawa couplings which predicts the lepton masses, providing at the same time an interesting experimental test for physics beyond the Standard Model.","created":"2001-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"violation: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau --> muon photon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon --> electron photon"}],"num_refs":57,"citation_count":31,"authors":["Carvalho, Daniel F.","Gomez, Mario E.","Khalil, Shaaban"]}

The scattering theory of Lax and Phillips, originally developed for classical wave equations, has been recently extended to the description of the evolution of resonant states in the framework of quantum theory. The resulting evolution law of the unstable system is that of a semigroup, and the resonant state is a well-defined funtion in the Lax-Phillips Hilbert space. In this paper we apply this theory to relativistically covarant quantum field theoretical form of the (soluble) Lee model. We show that this theory provides a rigorous underlying basis for the Lee-Oehme-Yang-Wu construction.","created":"2001-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":34,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theoretical model: relativistic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: electromagnetic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: acoustic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"resonance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Hilbert space"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Lee model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boson: field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"S-matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spectral representation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: Lax"}],"num_refs":34,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Strauss, Y.","Horwitz, L.P."]}

First, the theoretical context and the motivations for this study are discussed. In short, the hypercharge axion is introduced to explain the dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe and the existence of large-scale magnetic fields. Second, the phenomenological properties are analyzed and the distinguishing marks are underlined. These are basically the products of photons and $Z^0$s with high transverse momenta and invariant mass equal to that of the axion. Third, the simulation is carried out with two photons producing the axion which decays into $Z^0$s and/or photons. The event simulation is run through the simulator ATLFAST of ATLAS (A Toroidal Large Hadron Collider ApparatuS) at CERN. Finally, the characteristics of the axion decay are analyzed and the criteria for detection are presented. A study of the background is also included.

{"title":"Slave bosons in radial gauge: The correct functional integral representation and inclusion of nonlocal interactions","abstract":"We introduce a new path integral representation for slave bosons in the radial gauge which is valid beyond the conventional fluctuation corrections to a mean-field solution. For electronic lattice models, defined on the constrained Fock space with no double occupancy, all phase fluctuations of the slave particles can be gauged away if the Lagrange multipliers which enforce the constraint on each lattice site are promoted to time-dependent fields. Consequently, only the amplitude (radial part) of the slave boson fields survives. It has the special property that it is equal to its square in the physical subspace. This renders the functional integral for the radial field Gaussian, even when non-local Coulomb-type interactions are included. We propose (i) a continuum integral representation for the set-up of further approximation schemes, and (ii) a discrete representation with an Ising-like radial variable, valid for long-ranged interactions as well. The latter scheme can be taken as a starting point for numerical evaluations.","created":"2001-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":21,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"71.27.+a"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.10.-z"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.15.Me"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.15.Tk"},{"source":"author","value":"Strongly correlated electrons"},{"source":"author","value":"Field theories"},{"source":"author","value":"Non-perturbative methods"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boson: field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"path integral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radial gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boson: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: correlation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interaction: nonlocal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"continuum limit"}],"num_refs":41,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Fresard, R.","Kopp, T."]}

{"title":"Proton stability and superstring Z-prime","abstract":"Recently it was argued that proton lifetime limits impose that the scale of quantum gravity must be above 10^{16} GeV. By studying the proton stability in the context of realistic heterotic-string models, I propose that proton longevity necessitates the existence of an additional U(1)_{Z'} symmetry, which is of non-GUT origin and remains unbroken down to intermediate, or low, energies. It is shown that the realistic string models frequently give rise to U(1) symmetries, which suppress the proton decay mediating operators, with, or without, the possibility of R-parity violation. By studying the F- and D-flat directions, I examine whether the required symmetries remain unbroken in the supersymmetric vacuum and show that in some examples they can, whereas in others they cannot. The proton decay rate is proportional to the U(1)_{Z'} symmetry breaking scale. Imposing the proton lifetime limits I estimate the U(1)_{Z'} breaking scale and show that if substantial R-parity violation is present the associated Z' is within reach of forthcoming collider experiments","created":"2000-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"heterotic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z': mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: flat direction"}],"num_refs":49,"citation_count":33,"authors":["Faraggi, Alon E."]}

{"title":"A Gaussian sum rules analysis of scalar glueballs","abstract":"Although marginally more complicated than the traditional Laplace sum-rules, Gaussian sum-rules have the advantage of being able to probe excited and ground states with similar sensitivity. Gaussian sum-rule analysis techniques are applied to the problematic scalar glueball channel to determine masses, widths and relative resonance strengths of low-lying scalar glueball states contributing to the hadronic spectral function. A key feature of our analysis is the inclusion of instanton contributions to the scalar gluonic correlation function. Compared with the next-to-leading Gaussian sum-rule, the analysis of the lowest-weighted sum-rule (which contains a large scale-independent contribution from the low energy theorem) is shown to be unreliable because of instability under QCD uncertainties. The analysis of the next-to-leading sum-rule demonstrates that a single narrow resonance does not provide an adequate description of the hadronic spectral function. However, phenomenological models which distribute resonance strength over a broad region, such as a very wide resonance or well-separated narrow resonances, lead to excellent agreement between the theoretical prediction and phenomenological models. Our results indicate that the resonance contributions to the hadronic spectral function are spread over the region 1--1.6 GeV, either in the form of two narrow resonances at the ends of this range, or a wide resonance centered in this range.","created":"2000-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":18,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.55.Hx"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.-t"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.40.Cs"},{"source":"author","value":"Glueballs"},{"source":"author","value":"QCD gaussian sum-rules"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glueball: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glueball: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: sum rule"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glueball: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"instanton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: correlation function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":39,"citation_count":36,"authors":["Harnett, D.","Steele, Thomas G."]}

We introduce the parameters $\\eta_s^{atm}$ and $\\eta_s^{sun}$ which quantify an involvement of the sterile component in the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The (2+2)-scheme predicts $\\eta_s^{atm} + \\eta_s^{sun} = 1$ and the experimental proof of deviation from this equality will discriminate the scheme. In this connection the (3+1)-scheme is revisited in which the fourth (predominantly sterile) neutrino is isolated from a block of three flavour neutrinos by the mass gap $\\Delta m^2_{LSND} \\sim (0.4-10)$ eV$^2$. We find that in the (3+1)-scheme the LSND result can be reconciled with existing bounds on $\\nu_e$- and $\\nu_{\\mu}$ - disappearance at 95-99 % C.L..

{"title":"Supersymmetric CP violating currents and electroweak baryogenesis","abstract":"In this work we compute the CP-violating currents of the right-handed stops and Higgsinos, induced by the presence of non-trivial vacuum expectation values of the Higgs fields within the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) with explicit CP-violating phases. Using the Keldysh formalism, we perform the computation of the currents at finite temperature, in an expansion of derivatives of the Higgs fields. Contrary to previous works, we implement a resummation of the Higgs mass insertion effects to all orders in perturbation theory. While the components of the right-handed stop current j^\\mu_{\\widetilde t_R} become proportional to the difference H_2 \\partial^{\\mu}H_1-H_1 \\partial^{\\mu} H_2 (suppressed by \\Delta\\beta), the Higgsino currents, j^\\mu_{\\widetilde{H}_i}, present contributions proportional to both H_2 \\partial^{\\mu}H_1\\pm H_1 \\partial^{\\mu} H_2.

This relation is independent of the concrete properties of the ensemble of vortex loops, which are present in the theory under study. By virtue of the lattice result stating that the infrared asymptotic behaviours of these functions should have the same functional form, the obtained relation enables one to find these behaviours, as well as the infrared asymptotics of the bilocal correlator of densities of the vortex loops. Those turn out to be exponentials, decreasing at the inverse mass of the dual vector boson, times certain polynomials in the inverse integer powers of the distance.

We show that the latter contribution depends on the detailed prescription of the regularization process which is assumed to represent the Planck scale physics of the underlying fundamental theory. The usual anomaly mediation case with vanishing scalar masses at one loop is not found to be generic.

{"title":"QCD Phenomenology of Heavy Particle Dynamics","abstract":"In this thesis the phenomenology of Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) is studied in a variety of circumstances from both perturbative and non-perturbat ive perspectives. The main emphasis is on the production and hadronization of heavy particles, specifically heavy quarks, gauge bosons, leptoquarks and supersymmetric particles. In the hadroproduction of long-lived heavy quarks (i.e. charm and bottom) in the context of string fragmentation, the pull of a beam remnant at the other end of a string may give a heavy hadron more energy than the perturbatively produced quark. The collapse of a low-mass string to a single hadron is the extreme case of this effect, and gives rise to asymmetries between hadron and anti-hadron spectra. The Lund string fragmentation model is studied and improved by considering fixed-target data and the model is then used to predict the outcome of future experiments. The describtion of QCD radiation off heavy quarks and supersymmetric coloured particles is improved by using matrix element corrections to the massless parton shower in the event generator PYTHIA. In the process $e^+e^- \\to W^+ W^- \\to q\\bar{q}q^{\\prime} \\bar{q}^{\\prime}$, the colour flow can be ambiguous and a transverse momentum based measure of the colour flow is investigated as a tool to determine string topologies. The method is used to study different models of colour reconnection. QCD aspects of leptoquark production at HERA are discussed with focus on initialand final-state QCD radiation. By taking into account corrections to this in mass reconstructions of a leptoquark, a narrower mass peak and a better average mass value is obtained.","created":"2000-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":224,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"Subatomic Physics"},{"source":"author","value":"High energy interactions"},{"source":"author","value":"heavy quarks"},{"source":"author","value":"QCD"},{"source":"author","value":"charm asymmetry"},{"source":"author","value":"hadronization"},{"source":"author","value":"string fragmentation"},{"source":"author","value":"colour reconnection"},{"source":"author","value":"leptoquarks"},{"source":"author","value":"parton shower"},{"source":"author","value":"cosmic rays"},{"source":"author","value":"Kosmisk str��lning"},{"source":"author","value":"h��genergi"},{"source":"author","value":"Fysicumarkivet A:2000:Norrbin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"weak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electromagnetic interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"showers: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: fragmentation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":74,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Norrbin, Emanuel"]}

{"title":"Loop induced flavor changing neutral decays of the top quark in a general two Higgs doublet model","abstract":"Decays of the top quark induced by flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) are known to be extremely rare events within the Standard Model. This is so not only for the decay modes into gauge bosons, but most notably in the case of the Higgs channels, e.g. t-> H_{SM}+c, with a branching fraction of 10^{-13} at most. Therefore, detection of FCNC top quark decays in a future high-energy, and high-luminosity, machine like the LHC or the LC would be an indisputable signal of new physics. In this paper we show that within the simplest extension of the SM, namely the general two-Higgs-doublet model, the FCNC top quark decays into Higgs bosons, t->(h^{0},H^{0},A^{0})+c, can be the most favored FCNC modes -- comparable or even more efficient than the gluon channel t-> g+c. In both cases the optimal results are obtained for Type II models. However, only the Higgs channels can have rates reaching the detectable level (10^{-5}), with a maximum of order 10^{-4} which is compatible with the charged Higgs bounds from radiative B-meson decays. We compare with the previous results obtained in the Higgs sector of the MSSM.","created":"2000-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":18,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"12.15"},{"source":"author","value":"12.60.F"},{"source":"author","value":"14.80.C"},{"source":"author","value":"Top quark"},{"source":"author","value":"Higgs bosons"},{"source":"author","value":"Decays"},{"source":"author","value":"FCNC"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"doublet: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":40,"citation_count":123,"authors":["Bejar, Santi","Guasch, Jaume","Sola, Joan"]}

{"title":"Intersecting brane worlds","abstract":"It is known that chiral fermions naturally appear at certain intersections of branes at angles. Motivated by this fact, we propose a string scenario in which different standard model gauge interactions propagate on different (intersecting) brane worlds, partially wrapped in the extra dimensions. Quarks and leptons live at brane intersections, and are thus located at different positions in the extra dimensions. Replication of families follows naturally from the fact that the branes generically intersect at several points. Gauge and Yukawa couplings can be computed in terms of the compactification radii. Hierarchical Yukawa couplings appear naturally, since amplitudes involving three different intersections are proportional to exp{-A_{ijk}}, where A_{ijk} is the area of a string world-sheet extending among the intersections. The models are non-supersymmetric but the string scale may be lowered down to 1-10 TeV. The proton is however stable due to a set of discrete symmetries arising from world-sheet selection rules, exact to all orders in perturbation theory. The scenario has some distinctive features like the presence of KK, winding and other new excited states (`gonions'), with masses below the string scale and accessible to accelerators. The models contain scalar tachyons with the quantum numbers of standard SU(2) x U(1) Higgs doublets, and we propose that they induce electroweak symmetry breaking in a somewhat novel way. Specific string models with D4-branes wrapping on T^2 x (T^2)^2/Z_N, leading to three-family semirealistic spectra, are presented, in which the above properties are exemplified.","created":"2000-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":36,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: tachyon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: doublet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":55,"citation_count":403,"authors":["Aldazabal, G.","Franco, S.","Ibanez, Luis E.","Rabadan, R.","Uranga, A.M."]}

{"title":"The Development of equilibrium after preheating","abstract":"We present a fully nonlinear study of the development of equilibrium after preheating. Preheating is the exponentially rapid transfer of energy from the nearly homogeneous inflaton field to fluctuations of other fields and/or the inflaton itself. This rapid transfer leaves these fields in a highly nonthermal state with energy concentrated in infrared modes. We have performed lattice simulations of the evolution of interacting scalar fields during and after preheating for a variety of inflationary models. We have formulated a set of generic rules that govern the thermalization process in all of these models. Notably, we see that once one of the fields is amplified through parametric resonance or other mechanisms it rapidly excites other coupled fields to exponentially large occupation numbers. These fields quickly acquire nearly thermal spectra in the infrared, which gradually propagates into higher momenta. Prior to the formation of total equilibrium, the excited fields group into subsets with almost identical characteristics (e.g. group effective temperature). The way fields form into these groups and the properties of the groups depend on the couplings between them. We also studied the onset of chaos after preheating by calculating the Lyapunov exponent of the scalar fields.","created":"2000-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"preheating"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"chaos"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena: Lyapunov exponent"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"statistics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":15,"citation_count":115,"authors":["Felder, Gary N.","Kofman, Lev"]}

Using effective field theory methods, we delineate the scenarious under which experimental limits on permanent electric dipole moments (EDM's) of the electron, neutron, and neutral atoms as well as limits on TVPC observables provide the most stringent bounds on new TVPC interactions. Under scenarios in which parity invariance is restored at short distances, the one-loop EDM of elementary fermions generate the most severe constraints. The limits derived from the atomic EDM of $^{199}$Hg are considerably weaker. When parity symmetry remains broken at short distances, direct TVPC search limits provide the least ambiguous bounds. The direct limits follow from TVPC interactions between two quarks.","created":"2000-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":44,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time reversal: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parity: invariance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"atom: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: nonrenormalizable"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"new interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: (4quark)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"}],"num_refs":35,"citation_count":35,"authors":["Kurylov, A.","McLaughlin, G.C.","Ramsey-Musolf, M.J."]}

Two attitudes are possible in such situations: either to abandon statistical approach trying some other model or to generalise it to the so called nonextensive statistics (widely used in the similar circumstances in many other branches of physics).

{"title":"Nonthermal dark matter, high-energy cosmic rays and late decaying particles from inflationary quantum fluctuations","abstract":"It has been suggested that the origin of cosmic rays above the GZK limit might be explained by the decay of particles, X, with mass of the order of 10^{12} GeV. Generation of heavy particles from inflationary quantum fluctuations is a prime candidate for the origin of the decaying X particles. It has also been suggested that the problem of non-singular galactic halos might be explained if dark matter originates non-thermally from the decay of particles, Y, such that there is a free-streaming length of the order of 0.1Mpc. Here we explore the possibility that quantum fluctuations might account for the Y particles as well as the X particles. For the case of non-thermal WIMP dark matter with unsuppressed weak interactions we find that there is a general problem with deuterium photo-dissociation, disfavouring WIMP dark matter candidates. For the case of more general dark matter particles, which may have little or no interaction with conventional matter, we discuss the conditions under which X and Y scalars or fermions can account for non-thermal dark matter and cosmic rays. For the case where X and Y scalars are simultaneously produced, we show that galactic halos are likely to have a dynamically significant component of X scalar cold dark matter in addition to the dominant non-thermal dark matter component.","created":"2000-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: heavy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmic radiation: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"WIMP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"deuterium: photofission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"particle: density"}],"num_refs":36,"citation_count":5,"authors":["McDonald, John"]}

If temperature of the production time T_I is smaller than 5MeV, the bino-like LSP can be the WDM and may contribute to the small-scale structure of O(0.1) Mpc.

{"title":"The Superfluid phases of quark matter: Ginzburg-Landau theory and color neutrality","abstract":"We apply Ginzburg-Landau theory to determine BCS pairing in a strongly-coupled uniform superfluid of three-flavor massless quarks in flavor equilibrium. We elucidate the phase diagram near the critical temperature in the space of the parameters characterizing the thermodynamic potential terms of fourth order in the pairing gap. Within the color and flavor antisymmetric channel with zero total angular momentum, the phase diagram contains an isoscalar (IS) color-antitriplet phase and a color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase, reached by a second order transition from the normal state, as well as states reached by a first order transition. We complement the general Ginzburg-Landau approach by deriving the high-density asymptotic form of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy from the weak-coupling gap equation. The dynamically-screened, long-range color magnetic interactions are taken into account in solving the gap equation. We find that in the limit of weak coupling, the IS phase is less favorable near the transition temperature than the CFL phase. In view of the fact that deconfined quark matter must be color charge neutral, we incorporate the constraint of overall color neutrality into the Ginzburg-Landau theory and the gap equation. This constraint yields a disparity in the chemical potential between colors and reduces the size of the gap, in the presence of the anisotropy of the order parameters in color space. In comparison with the case in which there are no chemical potential differences between colors and hence the superfluid generally has nonzero net color charge, we find that while the constraint of color neutrality has only negligible effects on the gap in the weak coupling regime, it appreciably destabilizes the IS phase in the strong coupling regime without affecting the CFL phase.","created":"2000-11-21T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: superconductivity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Landau-Ginzburg model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong coupling: superfluid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: massless"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: chemical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interaction: long-range"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: weak coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: gap"}],"num_refs":48,"citation_count":161,"authors":["Iida, Kei","Baym, Gordon"]}

{"title":"Nonlinear gluon evolution in the color glass condensate. 1.","abstract":"We consider a nonlinear evolution equation recently proposed to describe the small-$x$ hadronic physics in the regime of very high gluon density. This is a functional Fokker-Planck equation in terms of a classical random color source, which represents the color charge density of the partons with large $x$. In the saturation regime of interest, the coefficients of this equation must be known to all orders in the source strength. In this first paper of a series of two, we carefully derive the evolution equation, via a matching between classical and quantum correlations, and set up the framework for the exact background source calculation of its coefficients. We address and clarify many of the subtleties and ambiguities which have plagued past attempts at an explicit construction of this equation. We also introduce the physical interpretation of the saturation regime at small $x$ as a Color Glass Condensate. In the second paper we shall evaluate the expressions derived here, and compare them to known results in various limits.","created":"2000-11-21T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":67,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"structure function: small-x"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Fokker-Planck equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field equations: Yang-Mills"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"classical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential equations: nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Lipatov equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background field"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glass: condensation"}],"num_refs":45,"citation_count":1211,"authors":["Iancu, Edmond","Leonidov, Andrei","McLerran, Larry D."]}

{"title":"Small x resummation and HERA structure function data","abstract":"We apply our systematic NLO small x resummation of singlet splitting functions to the scaling violations of structure functions and compare the results with data. We develop various theoretical tools which are needed in order to relate resummed parton distributions to measurable structure functions, and we present results from a variety of fits to HERA data for the structure functions F_2 and F_L using the resummation. The behaviour of the singlet splitting functions at small x and fixed Q^2 is effectively parametrized as x^{-lambda}. We find that, for lambda small or negative, the resummed description of scaling violations may be phenomenologically as good as or even better than the standard next-to-leading order treatment.

In particular, in the limit of small brane-bulk couplings, the electroweak eigenstates are predominantly given as a superposition of three light states with non-trivial small admixtures of bulk states. As a consequence, neutrinos can undergo standard oscillations as well as oscillation into bulk Kaluza-Klein states. We use this structure to construct a specific model based on Z_2 orbifolding and bulk Majorana masses which is compatible with all observed oscillation phenomena. The solar neutrino deficit is explained by oscillations into sterile bulk states while the atmospheric neutrino deficit is due to mu - tau oscillations with naturally maximal mixing. In addition, the model can accommodate the LSND result and a significant neutrino dark matter component.

{"title":"Physics of the nucleon sea quark distributions","abstract":"Sea quark distributions in the nucleon have naively been expected to be generated perturbatively by gluon splitting. In this case, there is no reason for the light quark and anti-quark sea distributions to be different. No asymmetries in the strange or heavy quark sea distributions are predicted in the improved parton model. However, recent experiments have called these naive expectations into question. A violation of the Gottfried sum rule has been measured in several experiments, suggesting that $\\bar u < \\bar d$ in the proton. Additionally, other measurements, while not definitive, show that there may be an asymmetry in the strange and anti-strange quark sea distributions. These effects may require nonperturbative explanations. In this review we first discuss the perturbative aspects of the sea quark distributions. We then describe the experiments that could point to nonperturbative contributions to the nucleon sea.

Chapter 3: Electron scattering with polarized targets at TESLA","abstract":"Measurements of polarized electron-nucleon scattering can be realized at the TESLA linear collider facility with projected luminosities that are about two orders of magnitude higher than those expected of other experiments at comparable energies. Longitudinally polarized electrons, accelerated as a small fraction of the total current in the e+ arm of TESLA, can be directed onto a solid state target that may be either longitudinally or transversely polarized. A large variety of polarized parton distribution and fragmentation functions can be determined with unprecedented accuracy, many of them for the first time. A main goal of the experiment is the precise measurement of the x- and Q^2-dependence of the experimentally totally unknown quark transversity distributions that will complete the information on the nucleon's quark spin structure as relevant for high energy processes. Comparing their Q^2-evolution to that of the corresponding helicity distributions constitutes an important precision test of the predictive power of QCD in the spin sector. Measuring transversity distributions and tensor charges allows access to the hitherto unmeasured chirally odd operators in QCD which are of great importance to understand the role of chiral symmetry. The possibilities of using unpolarized targets and of experiments with a real photon beam turn TESLA-N into a versatile next-generation facility at the intersection of particle and nuclear physics.","created":"2000-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron nucleon: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: polarized beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"solids: polarized target"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: transverse"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: helicity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: higher-twist"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fragmentation function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"deuteron: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"luminosity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spectrometer: acceptance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"experimental equipment: proposed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: DESY TESLA Linac"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":51,"citation_count":20,"authors":["Anselmino, M.","Aschenauer, E.C.","Belostotski, S.","Bialowons, W.","Blumlein, J.","Braun, V.","Brinkmann, R.","Duren, M.","Ellinghaus, F.","Goeke, K.","Goertz, St.","Gute, A.","Harmsen, J.","Jakob, R.","Kabuss, E.M.","Kaiser, R.","Korotkov, V.","Kroll, P.","Leader, E.","Lehmann-Dronke, B.","Mankiewicz, L.","Meier, A.","Meyer, W.","Meyners, N.","Mueller, Dieter","Mulders, P.J.","Nowak, W.D.","Niedermeier, L.","Oganessyan, K.","Pobilitsa, P.V.","Polyakov, M.V.","Reicherz, G.","Rith, K.","Ryckbosch, D.","Schafer, A.","Sinram, K.","Steffens, E.","Steijger, J.","van der Steenhoven, G.","von Harrach, D.","Weiss, C."]}

{"title":"Strong decays of scalar glueball in a scale invariant chiral quark model","abstract":"An effective meson Lagrangian including a scalar glueball is constructed on the base of $U(3)\\times U(3)$ chiral symmetry. The glueball is introduced into the meson Lagrangian by using the principle of scale invariance of an effective Lagrangian and the dilaton model. The singlet-octet mixing of scalar meson states is described by means of 't Hooft interaction. The contribution of the scalar and pseudoscalar anomalies into the breaking of scale invariance is taken into account. The mixing of quarkonia with the glueball is described. The mass spectrum of scalar mesons together with the glueball and also their strong decay widths are calculated. From comparing the obtained results with experimental data, it follows that $f_0(1500)$ is rather a glueball, whereas $f_0(1710)$ is a quarkonium. This accords with the results obtained in our previous works where radially-excited scalar meson states were described.

{"title":"The Minimal model of nonbaryonic dark matter: A Singlet scalar","abstract":"We propose the simplest possible renormalizable extension of the Standard Model - the addition of just one singlet scalar field - as a minimalist model for non-baryonic dark matter. Such a model is characterized by only three parameters in addition to those already appearing within the Standard Model: a dimensionless self-coupling and a mass for the new scalar, and a dimensionless coupling, \\lambda, to the Higgs field. If the singlet is the dark matter, these parameters are related to one another by the cosmological abundance constraint, implying that the coupling of the singlet to the Higgs field is large, \\lambda \\sim O(0.1 - 1). Since this parameter also controls couplings to ordinary matter, we obtain predictions for the elastic cross section of the singlet with nuclei. The resulting scattering rates are close to current limits from both direct and indirect searches. The existence of the singlet also has implications for current Higgs searches, as it gives a large contribution to the invisible Higgs width for much of parameter space. These scalars can be strongly self-coupled in the cosmologically interesting sense recently proposed by Spergel and Steinhardt, but only for very low masses (< 1 GeV), which is possible only at the expense of some fine-tuning of parameters.","created":"2000-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":25,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.80.-j"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.60.Fr"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: minimal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: singlet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"elastic scattering: scalar particle nucleus"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy loss"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":52,"citation_count":955,"authors":["Burgess, C.P.","Pospelov, Maxim","ter Veldhuis, Tonnis"]}

{"title":"Valence quark distributions in mesons in generalized QCD sum rules","abstract":"The method for calculation of valence quark distributions at intermediate $x$ is presented. The imaginary part of the virtual photon forward scattering amplitude on the quark current with meson quantum number is considered. Initial and final virtualities $p^2_1$ and $p^2_2$ of the currents are assumed to be large, negative and different, $p^2_1 \\not= p^2_2$. The operator product expansion (OPE) in $p^2_1, p^2_2$ up to dimension 6 operators is performed. Double dispersion representations in $p^2_1, p^2_2$ of the amplitude in terms of physical states contributions are used. Equalling them to those calculated in QCD by OPE the desired sum rules for quark distributions in mesons are found. The double Borel transformations are applied to the sum rules, killing non-diagonal transition terms, which deteriorated the accuracy in the previous calculations of quark distributions in nucleon. Leading order perturbative corrections are accounted. Valence quark distributions in pion, longitudinally and transversally polarized $\\rho$-mesons are calculated at intermediate $x$, $0.2 \\la x \\la 0.7$ and normalization points $Q^2 = 2-4 GeV^2$ with no fitting parameters. The use of the Regge behaviour at small $x$ and quark counting rules at large $x$ allows one to find the first and the second moments of valence quark distributions.

{"title":"Observing spin correlations in single top production and decay","abstract":"The weak decay of a polarized top quark has a rich structure of angular correlations among its decay products. We describe some of the noteworthy features of such decays. We then examine the three modes of single top production, with an emphasis on the status of calculations of the degree and direction of polarization at Run II of the Tevatron. The associated production of a top quark with a W boson will be very difficult to observe at the Tevatron. Prospects for observing the other two production mechanisms are much better. The spin state of the produced top quark is understood at leading order in the W* production channel.

{"title":"A Geometrical estimation of saturation of partonic densities","abstract":"We propose a new criterium for saturation of the density of partons both in nucleons and nuclei. It is applicable to any multiple scattering model which would be used to compute the number of strings exchanged in $ep$ and $eA$ collisions. The criterium is based on percolation of strings, and the onset of percolation is estimated from expectations coming from the study of heavy ion collisions at high energies. We interpret this onset as an indication of saturation of the density of partons in the wave function of the hadron. In order to produce quantitative results, a particular model fitted to describe present HERA data and generalized to the nuclear case is used. Nevertheless, with the number of scatterings controlled by the relation between inclusive and diffractive processes, conclusions are weakly model-dependent as long as different models are tuned to describe the experimental data. This constitutes a new approach, based on the eikonal description of soft hadronic collisions, and different from others which employ either perturbative QCD ideas or semiclassical methods. It offers an alternative picture for saturation in the small $Q^2$ region.","created":"2000-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"24.85.+p"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.80.La"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.60.Hb"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.40.Nn"},{"source":"author","value":"Saturation"},{"source":"author","value":"Partonic densities"},{"source":"author","value":"Multiple scattering"},{"source":"author","value":"Percolation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron nucleus: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model: hadronization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"percolation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon nucleus: nuclear reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Regge poles"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon p: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"multiple scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: eikonal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":49,"citation_count":15,"authors":["Armesto, N.","Salgado, C.A."]}

If the core of neutron stars are composed of quark matter with a normal component, cooling by direct quark Urca processes may be modified by non-Fermi liquid corrections. We find that while the quasiparticle density of states is finite and non-zero at the Fermi surface, its frequency derivative diverges and results in non-Fermi liquid corrections to the specific heat of the normal, degenerate component of quark matter. We study these non-perturbative non-Fermi liquid corrections to the specific heat and the temperature dependence of the chemical potential and show that these lead to a reduction of the specific heat.","created":"2000-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n: matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: liquid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: chemical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: emission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":50,"citation_count":19,"authors":["Boyanovsky, Daniel","de Vega, H.J."]}

We examine the implications of this framework for low energy constraints and the light Higgs boson mass. Undesirable contributions to proton decay and electric dipole moments, generic in many supersymmetric models, are strongly suppressed. As a result, the prediction for alpha_s in simple grand unified theories is 3 to 5 standard deviations closer to the experimental value, and the allowed CP-violating phases are larger by one to two orders of magnitude. In addition, the very heavy top and bottom squarks of focus point supersymmetry naturally produce a Higgs boson mass at or above 115 GeV without requiring heavy gauginos. We conclude with an extended discussion of issues related to the definition of naturalness and comment on several other prescriptions given in the literature.","created":"2000-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":31,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: magnetic moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":126,"citation_count":94,"authors":["Feng, Jonathan L.","Matchev, Konstantin T."]}

{"title":"Higgs, SUSY and the standard model at gamma gamma colliders","abstract":"In this report I surveyed physics potential of the gamma-gamma option of a Linear e+e- Collider with the following questions in mind: What new discovery can be expected at a gamma-gamma collider in addition to what will be learned at its `parent' e+e- Linear Collider? By taking account of the hard energy spectrum and polarization of colliding photons, produced by Compton back-scattering of laser light off incoming e- beams, we find that a gamma-gamma collider is most powerful when new physics appears in the neutral spin-zero channel at an invariant mass below about 80% of the c.m. energy of the colliding e-e- system. If a light Higgs boson exists, its properties can be studied in detail, and if its heavier partners or a heavy Higgs boson exists in the above mass range, they may be discovered at a gamma-gamma collider. CP property of the scalar sector can be explored in detail by making use of linear polarization of the colliding photons, decay angular correlations of final state particles, and the pattern of interference with the Standard model amplitudes. A few comments are given for SUSY particle studies at a gamma-gamma collider, where a pair of charged spinless particles is produced in the s-wave near the threshold. Squark-onium may be discovered. An e^\\pm gamma collision mode may measure the Higgs-Z-gamma coupling accurately and probe flavor oscillations in the slepton sector. As a general remark, all the Standard Model background simulation tools should be prepared in the helicity amplitude level, so that simulation can be performed for an arbitrary set of Stokes parameters of the incoming photon beams.","created":"2000-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":16,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Hamburg 2000/06/14"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: linear collider"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"linear collider: proposed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon photon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon electron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: angular correlation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"luminosity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"helicity: amplitude analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":59,"citation_count":19,"authors":["Hagiwara, Kaoru"]}

{"title":"Light front quantized QCD in light cone gauge","abstract":"The light-front (LF) quantization of QCD in light-cone gauge has a number of remarkable advantages, including explicit unitarity, a physical Fock expansion, the absence of ghost degrees of freedom, and the decoupling properties needed to prove factorization theorems in high momentum transfer inclusive and exclusive reactions. We present a systematic study of LF-quantized gauge theory following the Dirac method and construct the Dyson-Wick S-matrix expansion based on LF-time-ordered products. The free theory gauge field is shown to satisfy the Lorentz condition as an operator equation as well as the light-cone gauge condition. Its propagator is found to be transverse with respect to both its four-momentum and the gauge direction. The interaction Hamiltonian of QCD can be expressed in a form resembling that of covariant theory, except for additional instantaneous interactions which can be treated systematically. The renormalization constants in YM theory are shown to satisfy the identity $Z_1=Z_3$ at one loop order. The QCD $\\beta$ function computed in the noncovariant light-cone gauge agrees with that known in the conventional framework. Some comments on the relationship of our LF framework, with the doubly transverse gauge propagator, to the analytic effective charge and renormalization scheme defined by the pinch technique, the unitarity relations and the spectral representation are also made. LF quantization thus provides a consistent formulation of gauge theory, despite the fact that the hyperplanes $x^{\\pm}=0$ used to impose boundary conditions constitute characteristic surfaces of a hyperbolic partial differential equation.","created":"2000-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":31,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(N)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantization: light front"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light cone gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Hamiltonian formalism"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vertex function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group: beta function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"S-matrix: expansion"}],"num_refs":58,"citation_count":67,"authors":["Srivastava, Prem P.","Brodsky, Stanley J."]}

In the previous letter, we proposed a method of taking account of brane fluctuation by introducing Nambu-Goldstone bosons, and prove that when a tension of the brane is small, the interaction between boundary fields and Kaluza-Klein modes is suppressed exponentially. In this letter, we further investigate this suppression in more generic configuration, and obtain three counting rules, ``AND'', ``OR'' and ``STACK'' rules, depending on the softness of branes and the character of fields on the branes four dimensions.

If this scenario can be realized, gaugino masses will exhibit power-law running with scale, providing a possible solution to the supersymmetric flavor problem. While naive perturbative calculations hint at the appearance of ultraviolet-stable fixed points in certain theories, there are strong constraints following from limits on the scaling dimensions of gauge-invariant operators, positivity of central charges, and Cardy's conjectured constraint on the flow of the Euler coefficient in the stress tensor trace anomaly. Also, we prove that if ultraviolet-stable fixed points do exist, they cannot occur in the perturbative regime of a renormalizable model, and that all-orders results in the limit of large numbers of chiral superfields are necessarily inconclusive. However, we argue that the general idea of ultraviolet-stable fixed points in supersymmetric gauge theories is viable, and exhibit models that can satisfy all known constraints.","created":"2000-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: Yang-Mills"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"invariance: conformal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group: beta function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anomaly"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fixed point"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"central charge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":55,"citation_count":44,"authors":["Martin, Stephen P.","Wells, James D."]}

The lepton asymmetry is generated by a decaying right handed sneutrino, which is produced after inflation during preheating. The inflationary model is based on a simple variant of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard model (NMSSM) which solves the \\mu problem, called \\phiNMSSM, where the additional singlet \\phi plays the role of the inflaton in hybrid (or inverted hybrid) type models. The model is invariant under an approximate Peccei-Quinn symmetry which also solves the strong CP problem, and leads to an invisible axion with interesting cosmological consequences. We show how the baryon number of the universe and the nature of cold dark matter are determined by the same parameters controlling the strong CP problem, the \\mu problem and the neutrino masses and mixing angles.","created":"2000-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction: CP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"axion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon number"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mu-problem"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":70,"citation_count":15,"authors":["Bastero-Gil, M.","King, S.F."]}

Three generations of neutrinos are considered. The parameters whose ambiguities are considered are the differences of the squared masses, the mixing angles, and the density of matter. We first consider the statistics that are sensitive to the genuine CP-violation effect originating from the imaginary coupling. No ambiguity of the parameters is considered in this part. It is argued that the widely-adopted usual statistics are not necessarily sensitive to the genuine CP-violation effect. Two statistics that are sensitive to the imaginary coupling are proposed. The qualitative difference between these statistics and the usual one are discussed. Next we proceed to the case where the ambiguity of the parameters is present. The sensitivity of the CP-violation search is greatly spoiled when the baseline length is longer than about one thousand kilometers, which turns out to be due to the ambiguity of the matter effect. Thus the CP-violation search by use of CP conjugate channels turns out to require a low energy neutrino and short baseline length. It is also shown that such a loss of sensitivity is avoided by using T-conjugate oscillation channels.","created":"2000-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.60.Pq"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.15.+g"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.30.Er"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: storage ring"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time reversal: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: energy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":52,"citation_count":68,"authors":["Koike, Masafumi","Ota, Toshihiko","Sato, Joe"]}

{"title":"N=2 supersymmetry in a hybrid inflation model","abstract":"The slow roll inflation requires an extremely flat inflaton potential. The supersymmetry (SUSY) is not only motivated from the gauge hierarchy problem, but also from stabilizing that flatness of the inflaton potential against radiative corrections. However, it has been known that the Planck suppressed higher order terms in the K\\\"ahler potential receive large radiative corrections loosing the required flatness in the N = 1 supergravity. We propose to impose a global N = 2 SUSY on the inflaton sector. What we find is that the N = 2 SUSY Abelian gauge theory is exactly the same as the desired hybrid inflation model. The flat potential at the tree level is not our choice of parameters but a result of the symmetry. We further introduce a cut-off scale of the theory which is lower than the Planck scale.

{"title":"Exploring neutrino oscillations with superbeams","abstract":"We consider the medium- and long-baseline oscillation physics capabilities of intense muon-neutrino and muon-antineutrino beams produced using future upgraded megawatt-scale high-energy proton beams. In particular we consider the potential of these conventional neutrino ``superbeams'' for observing \\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_e oscillations, determining the hierarchy of neutrino mass eigenstates, and measuring CP-violation in the lepton sector. The physics capabilities of superbeams are explored as a function of the beam energy, baseline, and the detector parameters. The trade-offs between very large detectors with poor background rejection and smaller detectors with excellent background rejection are illustrated. We find that it may be possible to observe \\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_e oscillations with a superbeam provided that the amplitude parameter \\sin^2 2\\theta_{13} is larger than a few \\times 10^{-3}. If \\sin^2 2\\theta_{13} is of order 10^{-2} or larger, then the neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined in long-baseline experiments, and if in addition the large mixing angle MSW solution describes the solar neutrino deficit then there is a small region of parameter space within which maximal CP-violation in the lepton sector would be observable in a low-energy medium-baseline experiment. We explicitly consider massive water Cherenkov and liquid argon detectors at superbeams with neutrino energies ranging from 1 GeV to 15 GeV, and baselines from 295 km to 9300 km. Finally, we compare the oscillation physics prospects at superbeams with the corresponding prospects at neutrino factories. The sensitivity at a neutrino factory to CP violation and the neutrino mass hierarchy extends to values of the amplitude parameter \\sin^2 2\\theta_{13} that are one to two orders of magnitude lower than at a superbeam.","created":"2000-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":41,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/mu: beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/e"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"MSW effect effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"calorimeter: liquid argon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Cherenkov counter: water"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"proposed experiment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":125,"citation_count":107,"authors":["Barger, Vernon D.","Geer, S.","Raja, R.","Whisnant, K."]}

{"title":"Phenomenological study of the interactions violating the R parity symmetry in the supersymmetric theories","abstract":"The supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model can contain interactions violating the so-called R-parity symmetry. Such couplings would lead to the lepton and/or baryon number violation and modify deeply the phenomenology of supersymmetry at future particle colliders. We have worked out tests of the R-parity violating interactions. First, we have studied clear signals of the single production of supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles, which involves the R-parity violating interactions, in the context of physics at next leptonic and hadronic colliders. The results show that strong sensitivities could be obtained on the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters and indicate the possibility of an improvement of one to two order of magnitude concerning the present indirect limits on the values of several R-parity violating coupling constants. Besides, it has been verified that the single superpartner production analysis offers the opportunity to reconstruct in a model independent way some superpartner masses with an high accuracy. Secondly, we have studied CP symmetry violation effects, due to the complex phases of R-parity violating coupling constants, in the pair production of either fermions or sfermions of different flavors at future leptonic colliders. We have seen notably that the single top quark production allows to test the CP violation in the hadronic sector. The main conclusion of these works is that complex phases of certain R-parity violating coupling constants could be observed, and in particular within a scenario where those couplings would exhibit a strong hierarchy in flavor space.","created":"2000-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":436,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supergravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":143,"citation_count":16,"authors":["Moreau, Gregory"]}

{"title":"Aspects of nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum field theory","abstract":"This work is devoted to the study of relaxation--dissipation processes in systems described by Quantum Field Theory. In the first part, I focus on the phi^4 scalar quantum field theory in finite volume in the large N limit. I find that the zero-mode quantum fluctuations cannot grow macroscopically large starting from microscopic initial conditions, while the long-wavelength fluctuations do scale with the linear size of the system, signalling dynamical infrared properties quite different from the equilibrium ones. I also introduce a non-gaussian Hartree-Fock approximation (tdHF) and I derive the mean-field coupled time-dependent Schroedinger equations for the modes of the scalar field. The dynamical evolution of a uniform condensate is studied in a further controlled gaussian approximation, for N=1. Results similar to the large N case show an internal inconsistency of this approximation. I also study the dynamics of the system in infinite volume in the broken symmetry phase. The data show that the fixed points of the evolution cover at most the classically metastable part of the static effective potential. I finally study the dynamical evolution for the O(N+1) nonlinear sigma model in 1+1 dimensions in the large N limit. I first of all verify that the large coupling limit of the O(N+1) phi^4 model, which renders the model non linear, commutes with the large N limit, so that the O(infty) nonlinear sigma model is uniquely defined. I then study the evolution of several observables, like the spectrum of produced particles, finding no evidence for parametric resonance. I conclude with some remarks on the ``state of art'' in gauge theories and some comments about the open issues in the subject.","created":"2001-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":167,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"phi**n model: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"path integral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Hartree-Fock approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mathematical methods: variational"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sigma model: nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":101,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Manfredini, Emanuele"]}

{"title":"Studies in topics going beyond the standard electroweak model","abstract":"Supersymmetric Standard Model has been built to solve the hierarchy problem which is encountered whenever Standard Model is incorporated into a theory with a larger mass scale. Experimentally, one of the first signals of physics beyond Standard Model is provided by the atmospheric neutrino experiments which indicate the existence of at least one non-zero neutrino mass. An interpretation of both solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies in terms of neutrino oscillations would lead to specific patterns for neutrino masses and mixing. In this thesis, we studied the possibilities of generating the required neutrino mass patterns in the context of supersymmetric standard models with lepton number (L) violation. After an introduction to supersymmetric standard models in Chapter 1, we give an overview of neutrino phenomenology in chapter 2. Chapter 3 discusses analytical and semi-analytical solutions to Renormalisation Group Equations (RGE) with lepton number violating couplings in the superpotential. Neutrino masses with bilinear L violation in the context of gauge mediated supersymmetric models (GMSB) are discussed in Chapter 4, where 2-loop RGE for the parameter $\\Delta B_i$ are presented. Chapter 5 discusses neutrino mass structure when L violation is through trilinear lepton number violating terms. Chapter 6 discusses RG enhancement of neutrino masses and neutrino mass bounds on trilinear lepton number violating couplings in the context of mSUGRA. Chapter 7 summarises general features of neutrino masses within these models and contains overall conclusions based on the work presented in the thesis.","created":"2002-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":103,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group: scaling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: DESY HERA Stor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":242,"citation_count":3,"authors":["Vempati, Sudhir Kumar"]}

{"title":"Effet des boucles de quarks lgers sur la structure chirale du vide de QCD","abstract":"At low energies, QCD is governed by the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry (SBXS). If the number of light flavours $N_f$ could be increased from QCD ($N_f=3$), the pattern of SBXS should change due to light-quark loops. From the spectrum of the Euclidean Dirac operator, two chiral order parameters are shown to decrease when $N_f$ rises: the light-quark condensate $S=-$(most simple order parameter) and the pseudoscalar decay constant $F$ (nonambiguous signal of SBXS). The size of this decrease depends on the Zweig-rule violation in the scalar sector. The spectrum of pseudoscalar mesons (masses and decay constants) provides constraints on some low-energy constants that describe the chiral structure of the vacuum for $N_f=2$ ($m_u, m_d\\to 0$) and $N_f=3$ ($m_u, m_d, m_s\\to 0$). Further, experimental data in the $0^{++}$ sector can be used in a sum rule to get bounds on $S(2)-S(3)$. The presence of the $f_0$(980) resonance favours a steep decrease of $S$ between 2 and 3 flavours. This could be explained by the vicinity of a critical value of $N_f$ for which the quark condensate would vanish. Combinations of chiral order parameters highly sensitive to such a phase transition can be extracted by studying how inverse moments of the spectrum of the Dirac operator on an Euclidean torus depend on the volume. Lattice simulations of these inverse moments would provide clues about the phase transition $S(N_f)\\to 0$.","created":"2016-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":207,"num_refs":194,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Descotes-Genon, S��bastien"]}

This allows an improved description of multiple gluon emission effects off b and t quarks, and also off nonstandard particles like squarks and gluinos. Phenomenological applications are presented for bottom production at LEP, Higgs particle decay to heavy flavours, top production and decay at linear colliders, and some simple supersymmetric processes.","created":"2000-10-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":44,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Bx"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Cy"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.65.+i"},{"source":"author","value":"QCD phenomenology"},{"source":"author","value":"Parton showers"},{"source":"author","value":"Heavy particles"},{"source":"author","value":"Radiation patterns"},{"source":"author","value":"Supersymmetry events"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"showers: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: multiplicity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: fragmentation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse energy: energy flow"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parity: dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coherence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":47,"citation_count":154,"authors":["Norrbin, E.","Sjostrand, T."]}
{"title":"Bounds in proton proton elastic scattering at low momentum transfer","abstract":"We present a bound on the imaginary part of the single helicity-flip amplitude for spin 1/2-spin 1/2 scattering at small momentum transfer. The variational method of Lagrange multipliers is employed to optimize the single-flip amplitude using the values of the total cross section, the elastic cross section and diffraction slope as equality constraints in addition to the inequality constraints resulting from unitarity. Such bounds provide important information related to the determination of polarization of a proton beam. In the case of elastic proton collisions the analyzing power at small scattering angles inside the Coulomb Nuclear Interference region offers a method of measuring the polarization of a proton beam, the accuracy of the polarization measurement depending on the single helicity-flip amplitude. The bound obtained on the imaginary part of the single helicity-flip amplitude indicates that the analyzing power for proton-proton collisions in the Coulomb nuclear interference region should take positive nonzero values at high energies.","created":"2000-10-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.88.+e"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.90.+i"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"45.10.Db"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"helicity: amplitude analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"analytic properties"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum transfer: low"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dependence: momentum transfer"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unitarity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Lagrangian formalism"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"total cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: Coulomb"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interference"}],"num_refs":21,"citation_count":3,"authors":["Bates, A.T.","Buttimore, Nigel H."]}

A new method determines the values of the Regge intercepts in ``hard'' diffraction, confirming a higher value of the Pomeron intercept than for soft physics. The data are well described by a QCD analysis in which point-like parton distributions, evolving according to the DGLAP equations, are assigned to the leading and sub-leading Regge exchanges. The gluon distributions are found to be quite different for H1 and ZEUS. A {\\it global fit} analysis, where a higher twist component is taken from models, allows us to use data in the whole available range in diffractive mass and gives a stable answer for the leading twist contribution. We give sets of quark and gluon parton distributions for the Pomeron, and predictions for the charm and the longitudinal proton diffractive structure function from the QCD fit. An extrapolation to the Tevatron range is compared with CDF data on single diffraction. Conclusions on factorization breaking depend critically whether H1 (strong violation) or ZEUS (compatibility at low $\\beta$) fits are taken into account.","created":"2000-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"diffraction: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"structure function: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Regge poles"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: higher-twist"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"DGLAP equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: charm"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pomeron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: DESY HERA Stor"}],"num_refs":40,"citation_count":41,"authors":["Royon, C.","Schoeffel, L.","Bartels, Jochen","Jung, H.","Peschanski, Robert B."]}

For a fixed value of q, the model predicts specific dependence of \\lambda on pair mean momentum {\\bf K} so that, when |{\\bf K}|\\gsim 500 - 600 MeV/c for pions or when |{\\bf K}|\\gsim 700 - 800 MeV/c for kaons, the intercept \\lambda tends to a constant which is less than unity and determined by q.

Assuming a hierarchichal pattern of neutrino masses, these effects are large for only the third generation of sleptons. We construct mass combinations to isolate the effect of $f_{\\nu}$ from mass corrections already expected from tau Yukawa couplings. We then analyze the size of these effects, assuming that the Super-Kamiokande data constrain 0.033 eV $\\alt m_{\\nu_{\\tau}} \\alt 0.1$ eV and that neutrino masses arise via a see-saw mechanism. We also explore whether these effects might be detectable in experiments at future $e^+e^-$ linear colliders. We find that $m_{\\tnu_{\\tau}}$ needs to be measured with a precision of about 2-3% to measure the effect of $f_{\\nu}$ if the neutrino and top Yukawa couplings unify at the grand unification scale. In a simple case study, we find a precision of only 6-10% might be attainable after several years of operation. If the neutrino Yukawa coupling is larger, or in more complicated models of neutrino masses, a determination of $\\ttau_1$ and $\\tnu_{\\tau}$ masses might provide a signal of a Yukawa interaction of neutrinos.","created":"2000-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":29,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"slepton: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: measurement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":31,"citation_count":22,"authors":["Baer, Howard","Balazs, Csaba","Mizukoshi, J.Kenichi","Tata, Xerxes"]}

They increase the value of the decay rate by orders of magnitude near threshold or allow it below the nominal threshold. We discuss a procedure to take into account the finite-width effects and compare the results with previous studies of this decay.

Plotting the yields as a function of the hadron masses, we find very surprising results: we observe that the spectra are practically identical for e+e- at 91 GeV and central nucleus-nucleus reactions at SPS and RHIC energies, whereas the spectrum for proton-proton scattering is somewhat steeper. All have the form one expects if the particles were emitted by a canonical system which is characterized by a temperature and chemical potentials. These identical forms have, however, different origins: in e+e- and pp the exponential shape it is due to the statistical behavior of string fragmentation, which has absolutely nothing to do with thermalization, in AA it is caused by phase space. The fact that e+e- and nuclear results agree is pure coincidence. Surprisingly the results for pp and e+e- differ, although here the production mechanism is identical. In pp collisions we see directly that the string energy is very limited and hence the high mass baryons are suppressed.

{"title":"Implications of the ALEPH tau lepton decay data for perturbative and nonperturbative QCD","abstract":"We use ALEPH data on hadronic $\\tau$ decays in order to calculate Euclidean coordinate space correlation functions in the vector and axial-vector channels. The linear combination $V-A$ receives no perturbative contribution and is quantitatively reproduced by the instanton liquid model. In the case of $V+A$ the instanton calculation is in good agreement with the data once perturbative corrections are included. These corrections clearly show the evolution of $\\alpha_s$. We also analyze the range of validity of the Operator Product Expansion (OPE). In the $V-A$ channel we find a dimension $d=6$ contribution which is comparable to the original SVZ estimate, but the instanton model provides a different non-singular term of the same magnitude. In the $V+A$ case both the OPE and the instanton model predict the same $d=4$ power correction induced by the gluon condensate, but it is masked by much larger perturbative contributions. We conclude that the range of validity of the OPE is limited to $x\\lsim0.3$ fm, whereas the instanton model describes the data over the entire range.","created":"2000-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation function: vector"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation function: axial-vector"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"instanton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator product expansion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: ALEPH"}],"num_refs":18,"citation_count":37,"authors":["Sch��fer, Thomas","Shuryak, Edward V."]}

We study two modifications of the minimal model in order to obtain the mass scale relevant for atmospheric neutrino oscillations with at most O(1) higher-dimensional Yukawa couplings and with M_{\\ast} \\sim a few TeV. 1) In models with singlet fermions in smaller number of extra dimensions than gravity, we find that the effects on BR (\\mu \\to e \\gamma) and on charged-current universality in \\pi^- \\to e \\bar{\\nu}, \\mu \\bar{\\nu} decays are suppressed as compared to that in the minimal model with neutrino and gravity in the same space. 2) If small Dirac masses for the singlets are added along with lepton number violating couplings, then the mass scales and mixing angles for neutrino oscillations can be different from those relevant for \\mu \\to e \\gamma and \\pi^- \\to e \\bar{\\nu}, \\mu \\bar{\\nu}. Thus, in both modified models the constraints on M_{\\ast} from BR (\\mu \\to e \\gamma) and \\pi^- \\to e \\bar{\\nu}, \\mu \\bar{\\nu} decays can be significantly relaxed.

Although the quantum transition into the true vacuum from our false vacuum is highly suppressed, the thermal transition at high temperatures may not be neglected because of the thermal excitations. However, we find that the thermal transition is, in fact, negligibly small and hence the anomaly mediation models are cosmologically safe.

We then investigate the application of the Sinc function representation to simple QED diagrams, including first order corrections to the propagators and the vertex.","created":"2000-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: Euclidean"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vertex function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":7,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Petrov, Dmitri","Easther, Richard","Guralnik, Gerald","Hahn, Stephen","Wang, Wei-Mun"]}

{"title":"Searching for new physics via CP violation in B ---> pi pi","abstract":"It is well known that one can use B -> pi pi decays to probe the CP-violating phase \\alpha. In this paper we show that these same decays can be used to search for new physics. This is done by comparing two weak phases which are equal in the standard model: the phase of the t-quark contribution to the b -> d penguin amplitude, and the phase of Bd-Bd(bar) mixing. In order to make such a comparison, we require one piece of theoretical input, which we take to be a prediction for |P/T|, the relative size of the penguin and tree contributions to Bd -> pi^+ pi^-. If independent knowledge of \\alpha is available, the decay Bd(t) -> pi^+ pi^- alone can be used to search for new physics. If a full isospin analysis can be done, then new physics can be found solely through measurements of B -> pi pi decays. The most promising scenario occurs when the isospin analysis can be combined with independent knowledge of \\alpha. In all cases, the prospects for detecting new physics in B -> pi pi decays can be greatly improved with the help of additional measurements which will remove discrete ambiguities.","created":"2000-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: rare decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"amplitude analysis: isospin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"new interaction: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tree approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: penguin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B --> 2pi"}],"num_refs":36,"citation_count":11,"authors":["London, David","Sinha, Nita","Sinha, Rahul"]}

{"title":"LSND, SN1987A, and CPT violation","abstract":"We point out that neutrino events observed at Kamiokande and IMB from SN1987A disfavor the neutrino oscillation parameters preferred by the LSND experiment. For $\\Delta m^2 > 0$ (the light side), the electron neutrinos from the neutronization burst would be lost, while the first event at Kamiokande is quite likely to be due to an electron neutrino. For $\\Delta m^2 < 0$ (the dark side), the average energy of the dominantly $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ events is already lower than the theoretical expectations, which would get aggravated by a complete conversion from $\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ to $\\bar{\\nu}_e$. If taken seriously, the LSND data are disfavored independent of the existence of a sterile neutrino. A possible remedy is CPT violation, which allows different mass spectra for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and hence can accommodate atmospheric, solar and LSND data without a sterile neutrino. If this is the case, Mini-BooNE must run in $\\bar{\\nu}$ rather than the planned $\\nu$ mode to test the LSND signal.

The parity of these states is not measured, only assumed to be negative. In the hybrid picture, the lightest states are parity even and the parity odd counterparts lie about 300 MeV higher. Thus the hybrid ansatz predicts that either the parity of the $\\Lambda(1405)$ etc is positive, or that there are undiscovered positive parity states about 300 MeV lower.

Using experimental data for the B -> D,D^* mesonic Isgur-Wise functions this bound is established. Applying a QCD sum rule estimate of the Lambda_b -> Lambda_c transition form factor which satisfy the spectator quark model bound we predict the exclusive/inclusive ratio of semileptonic Lambda_b decay rates to lie in a range between 0.81 and 0.89. We also provide an upper bound on the baryonic Isgur-Wise function which is determined from the requirement that the exclusive rate should not exceed the inclusive rate.

The corresponding correct conditions, valid for all values of theta including theta>pi/4, are presented. An adiabaticity condition valid for all values of theta is also described. The results of accurate numerical computations of the level jumping probability in the Sun are presented. These calculations cover a wide range of Delta m^2, from the vacuum oscillation region to the region where the standard exponential approximation is good. A convenient empirical parametrization of these results in terms of elementary functions is given. The matter effects in the so-called \"quasi-vacuum oscillation regime\" are discussed.

The relation of factorization theorems in QCD with color coherence phenomena in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and color coherence phenomena in hard exclusive processes is emphasized. Analyzing numerically the QCD evolution equation for conventional and skewed parton densities in nuclei, we study the onset of generalized color transparency and nuclear shadowing of the sea quark and gluon distributions in nuclei as well as related phenomena. Such novel results as the dependence of the effective coherence length on $Q^2$ and general trends of the QCD evolution are discussed. The limits of the applicability of the QCD evolution equation at small Bjorken $x$ are estimated by comparing the inelastic quark-antiquark- and two gluon-nucleon (nucleus) cross sections, calculated within the DGLAP approximation, with the dynamical boundaries, which follow from the unitarity of the $S$ matrix for purely QCD interactions.

The single lepton channel is swamped by background processes; however, with suitable cuts, a trilepton signal emerges.

{"title":"Top mode standard model with extra dimensions","abstract":"We critically examine a version of the top mode standard model recently cast in extra dimensions by Arkani-Hamed, Cheng, Dobrescu, and Hall, based on the (improved) ladder Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation for the D-(=6,8-)-dimensional gauge theories. We find that the bulk QCD cannot have larger coupling beyond the non-trivial ultraviolet (UV) fixed point, the existence of which is supported by a recent lattice analysis. The coupling strength at the fixed point is evaluated by using the one-loop renormalization group equation. It is then found that, in a version with only the third family (as well as the gauge bosons) living in the D-dimensional bulk, the critical (dimensionless) coupling for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking to occur is larger than the UV fixed point of the bulk QCD coupling for D=6, while smaller for D=8. We further find that the improved ladder SD equation in D dimensions has an approximate scale-invariance due to the running of the coupling and hence has an essential-singularity scaling of the ``conformal phase transition,'' similar to Miransky scaling in the four-dimensional ladder SD equation with a nonrunning coupling. This essential-singularity scaling can resolve the fine-tuning even when the cutoff (``string scale'') is large. Such a theory has a large anomalous dimension \\gamma_m=D/2 - 1 and is expected to be free from the flavor-changing-neutral-current problem as in walking technicolor for D=4. Furthermore, the induced bulk Yukawa coupling becomes finite even at infinite cutoff limit (in the formal sense), similarly to the renormalizability of the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. Comments are made on the use of the ``effective'' coupling, which includes finite renormalization effects, instead of the \\bar{MS} running coupling in the improved ladder SD equation.","created":"2000-10-24T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":34,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: bound state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bound state: (top anti-top)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group: fixed point"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dyson-Schwinger equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"ladder approximation: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":56,"citation_count":61,"authors":["Hashimoto, Michio","Tanabashi, Masaharu","Yamawaki, Koichi"]}

{"title":"A Possible structure model of the vacuum: The Body center cubic model of the vacuum material","abstract":"This paper has deduced the baryon spectrum using only 2 flavored quarks u and d (each of them has three colored members). From Dirac's sea concept and the quark confinement idea, we conjecture and then assume that the quarks (in the vacuum state) compose colorless particles (uud and udd, hereafter will be called the Lee Particles). Moreover, the Lee Particles lead in a natural way to the construction - a body center cubic lattice in the vacuum. Consequently, there exists a strong interaction periodic field with body center cubic periodic symmetries and an electromagnetic interaction periodic field (from the charged Lee Particles uud) with simple cubic periodic symmetries in the vacuum. In terms of the energy band theory, using a point baryon approximation (i.e., omitting the structure of the Lee Particles), and from the symmetries of the strong interaction periodic field, we have deduced the intrinsic quantum numbers (I, S, C, b, Q) of all baryons and a unified mass formula from which all baryon masses can be found. This theoretical baryon spectrum is in accordance with the experimental results in both intrinsic quantum numbers and masses. These results show that various baryons are the energy band excited states of the Lee Particles. We also predict some new baryons: \\Lambda ^0(2559), \\Lambda ^0(4279), \\Xi_C(3169), \\Omega ^-(3619), \\Lambda_C^+(6659), \\Lambda_b^0(10159) ...

On the other hand, multiple nucleon-nucleon collisions mediated by color exchange interactions, excite their color degrees of freedom. We investigate the importance of this effect and find that these excited states provide a larger cross section for $J/\\psi$ absorption.

Electromagnetic gauge invariance (transversality) is maintained by including in addition to the twist-2 operators 'kinematical' twist-3 operators which appear as total derivatives of twist-2 operators. The non-forward matrix elements of the elementary twist-2 operators are parametrized in terms of two-variable spectral functions (double distributions), from which twist-2 and 3 skewed distributions are obtained through reduction formulas. Our approach is equivalent to a Wandzura-Wilczek type approximation for the twist-3 skewed distributions. The resulting Compton amplitude is manifestly transverse up to terms of order t/q^2.

{"title":"Coherent QCD phenomena in the coherent pion nucleon and pion nucleus production of two jets at high relative momenta","abstract":"We use QCD to compute the cross section for coherent production of a di-jet (treated as a $q\\bar q$ moving at high relative transverse momentum,$\\kappa_t $). In the target rest frame,the space-time evolution of this reaction is dominated by the process in which the high $\\kappa_t$ $q\\bar q$ component of the pion wave function is formed before reaching the target. It then interacts through two gluon exchange. In the approximation of keeping the leading order in powers of $\\alpha_s$ and all orders in $\\alpha_{s}\\ln(\\kappa_{t}^2/k_{0}^2),$ the amplitudes for other processes are shown to be smaller at least by a power of $\\alpha_{s}$. The resulting dominant amplitude is proportional to $z(1-z) \\kappa_t^{-4}$ ($z$ is the fraction light-cone(+)momentum carried by the quark in the final state) times the skewed gluon distribution of the target. For the pion scattering by a nuclear target, this means that at fixed $x_{N}= 2\\kappa_{t}^2/s$ (but $\\kappa_{t}^2\\to \\infty$) the nuclear process in which there is only a single interaction is the most important one to contribute to the reaction. Thus in this limit color transparency phenomena should occur.These findings are in accord with E971 experiment at FNAL. We also re-examine a potentially important nuclear multiple scattering correction which is positive and $\\propto A^{1/3}/\\kappa_t^4$. The meaning of the signal obtained from the experimental measurement of pion diffraction into two jets is also critically examined and significant corrections are identified.We show also that for values of $\\kappa_t$ achieved at fixed target energies, di-jet production by the e.m. field of the nucleus leads to an insignificant correction which gets more important as $\\kappa_t$ increases.","created":"2000-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":23,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"24.85.+p"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.85.Hd"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.87.-a"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"25.80.Hp"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi nucleon: coherent interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi nucleus: coherent interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering amplitude"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: transparency"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: multiple scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":79,"citation_count":57,"authors":["Frankfurt, L.","Miller, G.A.","Strikman, M."]}

Furthermore, the amount of lepton asymmetry produced in the early universe by the decay of the right-handed neutrino is very predictive and may be enough to explain the current baryon-to-photon ratio if the right-handed neutrinos are produced out of thermal equilibrium.

{"title":"New physics and the Landau pole","abstract":"In scalar field theories the Landau pole is an ultraviolet singularity in the running coupling constant that indicates a mass scale at which the theory breaks down and new physics must intervene. However, new physics at the pole will in general affect the running of the low energy coupling constant, which will in turn affect the location of the pole and the related upper limit (``triviality'' bound) on the low energy coupling constant. If the new physics is strongly coupled to the scalar fields these effects can be significant even though they are power suppressed. We explore the possible range of such effects by deriving the one loop renormalization group equations for an effective scalar field theory with a dimension 6 operator representing the low energy effects of the new physics. As an independent check we also consider a renormalizable model of the high-scale physics constructed so that its low energy limit coincides with the effective theory.","created":"2000-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":26,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"singularity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theoretical model: renormalizable"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"triviality: upper limit"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":11,"citation_count":7,"authors":["Chanowitz, Michael S."]}

{"title":"Report of the Tevatron Higgs working group","abstract":"This report presents the theoretical analysis relevant for Higgs physics at the upgraded Tevatron collider and documents the Higgs Working Group simulations to estimate the discovery reach in Run 2 for the Standard Model and MSSM Higgs bosons. Based on a simple detector simulation, we have determined the integrated luminosity necessary to discover the SM Higgs in the mass range 100-190 GeV. The first phase of the Run 2 Higgs search, with a total integrated luminosity of 2 fb-1 per detector, will provide a 95% CL exclusion sensitivity comparable to that expected at the end of the LEP2 run. With 10 fb-1 per detector, this exclusion will extend up to Higgs masses of 180 GeV, and a tantalizing 3 sigma effect will be visible if the Higgs mass lies below 125 GeV. With 25 fb-1 of integrated luminosity per detector, evidence for SM Higgs production at the 3 sigma level is possible for Higgs masses up to 180 GeV. However, the discovery reach is much less impressive for achieving a 5 sigma Higgs boson signal. Even with 30 fb-1 per detector, only Higgs bosons with masses up to about 130 GeV can be detected with 5 sigma significance. These results can also be re-interpreted in the MSSM framework and yield the required luminosities to discover at least one Higgs boson of the MSSM Higgs sector. With 5-10 fb-1 of data per detector, it will be possible to exclude at 95% CL nearly the entire MSSM Higgs parameter space, whereas 20-30 fb-1 is required to obtain a 5 sigma Higgs discovery over a significant portion of the parameter space. Moreover, in one interesting region of the MSSM parameter space (at large tan(beta)), the associated production of a Higgs boson and a b b-bar pair is significantly enhanced and provides potential for discovering a non-SM-like Higgs boson in Run 2.","created":"2000-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":185,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: charged particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"new interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"topcolor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"experimental methods"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"luminosity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"statistical analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"DZERO"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CDF"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"upgrade"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"proposed experiment: Batavia TEVATRON Coll"}],"num_refs":275,"citation_count":514,"authors":["Carena, Marcela","Conway, John S.","Haber, Howard E.","Hobbs, John D.","Albrow, Michael G.","Baer, Howard","Barberis, Emanuela","Barrientos Bendezu, A.A.","Bhat, Pushpalatha","Belyaev, Alexander","Balazs, Csaba","Bokhari, Wasiq","Borzumati, Francesca","Chakraborty, Dhiman","Coarasa Perez, Jose Antonio","Culbertson, Ray","Demina, Regina","Diaz-Cruz, J.Lorenzo","Dicus, Duane","Dobrescu, Bogdan A.","Dorigo, Tommaso","Dreiner, Herbert K.","Ellis, R.Keith","Frisch, Henry J.","Garcia, David","Gilmartin, Russell","Gonzalez-Garcia, Maria Concepion","Guasch, Jaume","Goussiou, Anna","Han, Tao","Harris, Brian W.","He, Hong-Jian","Hedin, David","Heinemeyer, Sven","Heintz, Ulrich","Hollik, Wolfgang","Jesik, Richard","Kilminster, Ben","Kniehl, Bernd A.","Kneur, Jean-Loic","Kuhlmann, Stephen","Kruse, Mark","Lami, Stefano","Landsberg, Greg L.","Lietti, Sergio M.","Litvintsev, Dmitri","Loomis, Charles","Lucotte, Arnaud","Matchev, Konstantin T.","Mrenna, Stephen","Murat, Pasha","Novaes, Sergio F.","Polonsky, Nir","Prosper, Harrison","Pukhov, Alexander","Ribon, Alberto","Roco, Maria","Rostovtsev, Andrey","Schmitt, Michael","Sirotenko, Vladimir","Snihur, Robert","Sola, Joan","Spira, Michael","Stelzer, Tim","Sullivan, Zack","Tait, Timothy M.P.","Tata, Xerxes","Turcot, Andre S.","Valls, Juan","Veseli, Sinisa","Vilar, Rocio","Watts, Gordon","Wagner, Carlos E.M.","Weiglein, Georg","Willenbrock, Scott","Womersley, John","Yao, Weiming","Yuan, Chien-Peng","Zeppenfeld, Dieter","Zhang, Ren-Jie"]}

The bare (qbar q) scalars are strongly distorted by hadronic mass shifts, and the (ubar u+ dbar d) state becomes a very broad resonance, with its pole at 470-i250 MeV. This is the sigma meson required by models for spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. We also discuss the less well known phenomenon that with a large coupling there can appear two physical resonance poles on the second sheet although only one bare quark-antiquark state is put in. The f_0(980) and f_0(1370) resonance poles can thus be two manifestations of the same (sbar s) quark state. Both of these are dominant in the E791 Dalitz plot of D_s-> 3pi, where (sbar s) intermediate states should be dominant. Recently this light sigma has clearly been observed in D-> sigma pi-> 3pi by the E791 experiment at Fermilab.

A careful analysis suggests that the top quark mass can be extracted from a threshold scan at NLC with an accuracy of about 100 MeV.","created":"2000-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Batavia 2000/10/24"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"threshold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":22,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Yakovlev, Oleg I.","Groote, Stefan"]}

{"title":"Electroweak symmetry breaking and extra dimensions","abstract":"The electroweak symmetry may be broken by a composite Higgs which arises naturally as a bound state of the top quark if the standard model gauge fields and fermions propagate in extra dimenions. The top quark mass and the Higgs mass can be predicted from the infrared fixed points of the renormalization group equations. The top quark mass is in good agreement with the experimental value, and the Higgs boson mass is predicted to be $\\sim 200$ GeV. The bounds on the compactification scale can be quite low if all standard model fields propagate in the same extra dimensions due to the momentum conservation in extra dimensions. The current lower limits are about 300 GeV for one extra dimension and 400-800 GeV for two extra dimensions. The future collider experiments may either discover the Kaluza-Klein (KK) states of the standard model fields or raise their mass limits significantly. There may also be some other light bound states which could be observed at upcoming collider experiments.","created":"2000-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Fermilab 2000/10/24"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: composite"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"infrared problem: fixed point"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":14,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Cheng, Hsin-Chia"]}

{"title":"Future summary: Closing talk delivered at LEPfest","abstract":"We are emerging from a period of consolidation in particle physics. Its great, historic achievement was to establish the Theory of Matter. This Theory will serve as our description of ordinary matter under ordinary conditions -- allowing for an extremely liberal definition of \"ordinary -- for the foreseeable future. Yet there are many indications, ranging from the numerical to the semi-mystical, that a new fertile period lies before us. We will discover compelling evidence for the unification of fundamental forces and for new quantum dimensions (low-energy supersymmetry). We will identify new forms of matter, which dominate the mass density of the Universe. We will achieve much better fundamental understanding of the behavior of matter in extreme astrophysical and cosmological environments. Lying beyond these expectations, we can identify deep questions that seem to call for ideas outside our present grasp.

{"title":"Baryon transport in dual models and the possibility of a backward peak in diffraction","abstract":"Dual string models contain significant baryon transfers and seem essentially consistent with the available data. We here turn to a careful consideration of the relevant topological structures. The baryon transfer is associated with one of two possible types of cuts in various baryonium exchanges. As the baryonium with the highest intercept easily couples to two Pomerons such transfers should occur abundantly in percolating dense Pomerons systems. From the color structure this quark-less baryonium can be identified with an Odderon exchange. As the Odderon is predicted to have an almost Pomeron -like trajectory it has to involve small coupling constants so that steeper trajectories can initially determine the data. As this suppression is not anticipated for diffractive processes a tiny observable backward peak should occur in the initial baryon distribution for massive diffractive systems.","created":"2001-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Tihany 2000/10/09"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"diffraction: backscatter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transport theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model: duality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: topological"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: energy loss"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: pomeron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: odderon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"}],"num_refs":39,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Bopp, Fritz W."]}

Emission of gluons causes the string to trace more complicated surfaces in Minkowski space, and some form of generalization of the 1+1 dimensional model is required. One such generalizaiotn has been developed and implemented as a Monte Carlo routine \"JETSET\" by Torbj\\\"orn Sj\\\"ostrand, which has been hightly successful in describing experimental data. But there are theoretical reasons to believe that the fragmentation scheme employed in JETSET is not entirely satisfactory; most notably, non-adherance to the Lund Area law, and certain problems in handling transverse momenta. A few alternative scenarios, which we have examined in detail and implemented in separate computer programs, will be presented here, with comparisons to JETSET in certain simple cases. Our effort has been to preserve the area law for the fragmentation of a gluonic string, while we explored the possibility of allowing the fragmentation process to reshape the string surface slightly.","created":"2001-01-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Tihany 2000/10/09"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model: fragmentation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: string"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"final state: (3jet)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rapidity spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: transverse momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"}],"num_refs":1,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Andersson, Bo","Soderberg, Fredrik","Mohanty, Sandipan"]}

{"title":"Supersymmetric Radiative Corrections at Large Tan $\\beta$","abstract":"In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), fermion masses and Yukawa couplings receive radiative corrections at one loop from diagrams involving the supersymmetric particles. The corrections to the relation between down-type fermion masses and Yukawa couplings are enhanced by tan beta, which makes them potentially very significant at large tan beta. These corrections affect a wide range of processes in the MSSM, including neutral and charged Higgs phenomenology, rare B meson decays, and renormalization of the CKM matrix. We give a pedagogical review of the sources and phenomenological effects of these corrections.","created":"2001-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Minneapolis 2000/10/13"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: (Higgs particle antiquark quark)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Higgs"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B0 anti-B0: mixing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CKM matrix: renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"beauty --> strangeness photon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B --> lepton antilepton"}],"num_refs":61,"citation_count":16,"authors":["Logan, Heather E."]}

For high collision energies and small qT (minijets) we enter the BFKL region. This implies that we must take into account off-shell parton cross sections and non-integrated structure functions (kT-factorization). It is also essential to avoid double counting, as one emitted parton is a participant in two different subcollisions. The LDC model, developed in Lund to describe DIS, provides a very convenient formalism to handle these problems. The result is a dynamical suppression of minijets for small qT. The resulting transverse energy flow is similar to the result from a ''naive'' calculation based on integrated structure functions with a qT cut-off around 2 GeV.","created":"2001-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":6,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Tihany 2000/10/09"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: minijet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse energy: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"structure function: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: hadronization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":8,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Gustafson, Gosta"]}

{"title":"The Scale of supersymmetry breaking as a free parameter","abstract":"While supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model can be fully described in terms of explicitly broken global supersymmetry, this description is only effective. Once related to spontaneous breaking in a more fundamental theory, the effective parameters translate to functions of two distinct scales, the scale of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and the scale of its mediation to the standard-model fields. The scale dependence will be written explicitly and the full spectrum of supersymmetry breaking operators which emerges will be explored. It will be shown that, contrary to common lore, scale-dependent operators can play an important role in determining the phenomenology. For example, theories with low-energy supersymmetry breaking, such as gauge mediation, may correspond to a scalar potential which is quite different than in theories with high-energy supersymmetry breaking, such as gravity mediation. As a concrete example, the Higgs mass prediction will be discussed in some detail and its upper bound will be shown to be sensitive to the supersymmetry breaking scale.","created":"2001-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":9,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Minneapolis 2000/10/13"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: spontaneously broken"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling: dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"upper limit"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":26,"citation_count":4,"authors":["Polonsky, Nir"]}

In the presence of a supercritical field the neutral vacuum state of QED becomes unstable and decays into a charged vacuum, signalled by the spontaneous emission of positrons.

Clear experimental signals for spontaneous positron creation are still missing and could only be expected from collisions with a prolonged time scale.

Finally, the subject of parton-parton correlations is introduced, along with new data related to higher twist effects and skewed parton distributions.","created":"2001-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Osaka 2000/10/16"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"review: experimental results"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton nucleus: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton nucleus: nuclear reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: polarized beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: polarized target"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton nucleon: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hard scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"structure function: spin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"structure function: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"structure function: transversity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation: (2parton)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: leptoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Compton scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"HERMES"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"DESY HERA Stor"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Aschenauer, E.C."]}
{"title":"High energy hadron spin observables: Microscopic QRC model and spin asymmetry","abstract":"We briefly review concept of the quark recombination (QRC) model and a general success of the model. To solve the existing problem, so called anomalous spin observables, in the high energy hyperon spin phenomena, we propose a mechanism; the primarily produced quarks, which are predominantly u and d quarks, act as the leading partons to form the hyperons. Extension of the quark recombination concept with this mechanism is successful in providing a good account of the anomalous spin observables. Another kind of anomaly, the non-zero analyzing power and spin depolarization in the �� hyperon productions, are also discussed and well understood by the presently proposed mechanism. Recently, a further difficulty was observed in an exclusive ��K+p production and we will indicate a possible diagram for resolving it.","created":"2001-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":9,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Osaka 2000/10/16"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p nucleus: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus nucleus: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus nucleus: nuclear reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: multiple production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hyperon: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: recombination"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Lambda: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"analyzing power"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: depolarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p --> Lambda anything"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p --> Lambda p K+"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Kubo, K."]}

{"title":"Constraints of a parity-conserving/time-reversal-non-conserving interaction","abstract":"Time-Reversal-Invariance non-conservation has for the first time been unequivocally demonstrated in a direct measurement, one of the results of the CPLEAR experiment. What is the situation then with regard to time-reversal-invariance non-conservation in systems other than the neutral kaon system? Two classes of tests of time-reversal-invariance need to be distinguished: the first one deals with parity violating (P-odd)/time-reversal-invariance non-conserving (T-odd) interactions, while the second one deals with P-even/T-odd interactions (assuming CPT conservation this implies C-conjugation non-conservation). Limits on a P-odd/T-odd interaction follow from measurements of the electric dipole moment of the neutron. This in turn provides a limit on a P-odd/T-odd pion-nucleon coupling constant which is less than 10���4 times the weak interaction strength. Limits on a P-even/T-odd interaction are much less stringent. The better constraint stems also from the measurement of the electric dipole moment of the neutron. Of all the other tests, measurements of charge-symmetry breaking in neutron-proton elastic scattering provide the next better constraint. The latter experiments were performed at TRIUMF (at 477 and 347 MeV) and at IUCF (at 183 MeV). Weak decay experiments (e.g., the transverse polarization of the muon in K+�����0��+����) have the potential to provide comparable or possibly better constraints.","created":"2001-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Osaka 2000/10/16"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parity: conservation law"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time reversal: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p n: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"analyzing power: angular dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: one-photon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: two-pion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interference: (omega(783) rho(770))"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass difference: (n p)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K+: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: transverse"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["van Oers, W.T.H."]}
