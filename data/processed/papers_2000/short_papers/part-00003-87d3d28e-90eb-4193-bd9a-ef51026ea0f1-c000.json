We compute $R$ in the disputed region with data from outside this region and asymptotic behavior given by the standard model with 5 quark flavors, and find agreement with the Crystal Ball result. On the other hand, the MARK I data are reproduced if we augment the asymptotic behavior with contributions from a single spin zero quark of charge ($ -1/3$). The visible hadronic fragments from such scalar quarks are not likely to produce predominantly pure 2-jet events at such low energies. Hence, such decay modes may have been removed by the Crystal Ball energy imbalance cuts in their definition of hadronic events but not in MARK I events, thus accounting for the discrepancy in the two results. Upper bounds on spin zero quark production at LEP through $Z$ decay data are used to estimate the mixing angle between $T_3\\ = -1/2$ and $T_3 = 0$ scalar quarks.

The limits on F may be obtained from direct and indirect measurements of sgoldstino coupling to photons, leptons, mesons and nucleons. There are three sources of constraints: (i)��astrophysics and cosmology; (ii)��precision laboratory experiments at low energies; (iii)��rare decays. We discuss only processes with real sgoldstinos. For sgoldstino lighter than a few MeV and superpartner masses of the order of electroweak scale, astrophysical and reactor bounds on F are significantly stronger than limits which may be reached at future colliders. In models with heavier sgoldstino (up to 5��GeV), constraints from flavor conserving decays of mesons are complementary to ones coming from collider experiments. The most sensitive probes of sgoldstinos are flavor violating processes, provided that flavor is violated in squark and/or slepton sector. It is shown that sgoldstino contributions into FCNC and lepton flavor violation are strong enough to probe the supersymmetry breaking scale up to F ���10 7 ��GeV, if off-diagonal entries in squark (slepton) mass matrices are close to the current limits in MSSM.","created":"2000-07-31T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":16,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.60.Jv"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.90.+i"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.80.-j"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sgoldstino: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sgoldstino: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sgoldstino: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sgoldstino: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: rare decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sgoldstino: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":67,"citation_count":58,"authors":["Gorbunov, D.S."]}

When no-scale boundary conditions are given at the Grand Unified scale and universal gaugino masses are postulated, a bino mass is quite degenerate with right-handed slepton masses and the requirement that the lightest superparticle (LSP) be neutral supplemented with slepton searches at LEP200 severely constrains allowed mass regions of superparticles. The situation drastically changes if one moderately relaxes the assumption of the universal gaugino masses. After reviewing some interesting scenarios where non-universal gaugino masses arise, we show that the non-universality diminishes the otherwise severe constraint on the superparticle masses, and leads a variety of superparticle mass spectra: in particular the LSP can be a wino-like neutralino, a higgsino-like neutralino, or even a sneutrino, and also left-handed sleptons can be lighter than right-handed ones.","created":"2000-07-31T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: Kaehler"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gaugino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boundary condition"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"slepton: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"slepton: left-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":56,"citation_count":36,"authors":["Komine, Shinji","Yamaguchi, Masahiro"]}

{"title":"Vacuum structure and the axion walls in gluodynamics and QCD with light quarks","abstract":"Large N gluodynamics was shown to have a set of metastable vacua with the gluonic domain walls interpolating between them. The walls may separate the genuine vacuum from an excited one, or two excited vacua which are unstable at finite N (here N is the number of colors). One may attempt to stabilize them by switching on the axion field. We study how the light quarks and the axion affect the structure of the domain walls. In pure gluodynamics (with the axion field) the axion walls acquire a very hard gluonic core. Thus, we deal with a wall \"sandwich\" which is stable at finite N. In the case of the minimal axion, the wall \"sandwich\" is in fact a \"2-pi\" wall, i.e., the corresponding field configuration interpolates between identical hadronic vacua. The same properties hold in QCD with three light quarks and very large number of colors. However, in the realistic case of three-color QCD the phase corresponding to the axion field profile in the axion wall is screened by a dynamical phase associated with the eta-prime, so that the gluon component of the wall is not excited. We propose a toy Lagrangian which models these properties and allows one to get exact solutions for the domain walls.","created":"2000-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: domain wall"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N: color"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"axion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"eta(958)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":53,"citation_count":23,"authors":["Gabadadze, Gregory","Shifman, Mikhail A."]}
{"title":"Chiral fermions, orbifolds, scalars and fat branes","abstract":"We note that orbifold boundary conditions that produce chiral fermion zero modes in compactified higher dimensional theories may distort scalar field vacuum expectation values, giving rise to nontrivial dependence on the extra dimensions. We illustrate this in a simple five dimensional model which has chiral fermion zero-modes stuck to fat branes. The model could provide a simple and explicit realization of the separation of quarks and leptons in the fifth dimension. We discuss the KK expansion in some detail. We find that there are in general non-zero-mode states stuck to the brane, like the chiral zero modes. We see explicitly the transition from states dominated by the internal structure of the fat brane to those dominated by the compactification.","created":"2000-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"orbifold: boundary condition"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"zero mode"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum mechanics"}],"num_refs":11,"citation_count":121,"authors":["Georgi, Howard","Grant, Aaron K.","Hailu, Girma"]}

{"title":"The Infrared behavior of QCD Green's functions: Confinement dynamical symmetry breaking, and hadrons as relativistic bound states","abstract":"Recent studies of QCD Green's functions and their applications in hadronic physics are reviewed. We briefly discuss the issues of gauge fixing, BRS invariance and positivity. Evidence for the violation of positivity by quarks and transverse gluons in the covariant gauge is collected, and it is argued that this is one manifestation of confinement. We summarise the derivation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) of QED and QCD. The influence of instantons on DSEs in a 2-dimensional model is mentioned. Solutions for the Green's functions in QED in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions provide tests of various schemes to truncate DSEs. We discuss possible extensions to QCD and their limitations. Truncation schemes for DSEs of QCD are discussed in the axial gauge and in the Landau gauge. We review the available results from a systematic non-perturbative expansion scheme established for Landau gauge QCD. Comparisons to related lattice results, where available, are presented. The applications of QCD Green's functions to hadron physics are summarized. Properties of ground state mesons are discussed on the basis of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for quarks and antiquarks. The Goldstone nature of pseudoscalar mesons and mechanisms of diquark confinement are reviewed.

{"title":"Exact and truncated dynamics in nonequilibrium field theory","abstract":"Nonperturbative dynamics of quantum fields out of equilibrium is often described by the time evolution of a hierarchy of correlation functions, using approximation methods such as Hartree, large N, and nPI-effective action techniques. These truncation schemes can be implemented equally well in a classical statistical system, where results can be tested by comparison with the complete nonlinear evolution obtained by numerical methods. For a 1+1 dimensional scalar field we find that the early-time behaviour is reproduced qualitatively by the Hartree dynamics. The inclusion of direct scattering improves this to the quantitative level. We show that the emergence of nonthermal temperature profiles at intermediate times can be understood in terms of the fixed points of the evolution equations in the Hartree approximation. The form of the profile depends explicitly on the initial ensemble. While the truncated evolution equations do not seem to be able to get away from the fixed point, the full nonlinear evolution shows thermalization with a (surprisingly) slow relaxation.","created":"2000-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":30,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation function: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Hartree approximation: classical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fixed point"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"zero mode"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"}],"num_refs":32,"citation_count":90,"authors":["Aarts, Gert","Bonini, Gian Franco","Wetterich, Christof"]}

Starting from an inflationary scenario which could explain the different initial temperatures of the two sectors, we study the time history of the early mirror universe. In particular, we show that in the context of the GUT or electroweak baryogenesis scenarios, the baryon asymmetry in the mirror world should be larger than in the observable one and in fact the mirror baryons could provide the dominant dark matter component of the universe. In addition, analyzing the nucleosynthesis epoch, we show that the mirror helium abundance should be much larger than that of ordinary helium.

{"title":"Higgs particles in the standard model and supersymmetric theories","abstract":"This thesis presents a theoretical analysis of the properties of the Higgs bosons in the Standard Model (SM) and the minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM), which can be investigated at the LHC and $e^+e^-$ linear colliders. The final goal is the reconstruction of the Higgs potential and thus the verification of the Higgs mechanism. MSSM Higgs boson production processes at future $\\gamma\\gamma$ colliders are calculated in several decay channels. Heavy scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons can be discovered in the $b\\bar{b}$ final state in the investigated mass range 200 to 800 GeV for moderate and large values of $\\tan\\beta$. The $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channel provides a heavy Higgs boson discovery potential for large values of $\\tan\\beta$. Several mechanisms that can be exploited at $e^+e^-$ linear colliders for the measurement of the lifetime of a SM Higgs boson in the intermediate mass range are analysed. In the $WW$ mode, the lifetime of Higgs scalars with masses below $\\sim 160$ GeV can be determined with an error less than 10%. The reconstruction of the Higgs potential requires the measurement of the Higgs self-couplings. The SM and MSSM trilinear Higgs self-couplings are accessible in double and triple Higgs production. A theoretical analysis is presented in the relevant channels at the LHC and $e^+e^-$ linear colliders. For high luminosities, the SM trilinear Higgs self-coupling can be measured with an accuracy of 20% at a 500 GeV $e^+e^-$ linear collider. The MSSM coupling among three light Higgs bosons has to be extracted from continuum production. The other trilinear Higgs couplings are measurable in a restricted range of the MSSM parameter space. At the LHC, the $Hhh$ coupling can be probed in resonant decays.","created":"2000-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":106,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiple production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon photon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: (3Higgs particle)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":189,"citation_count":63,"authors":["Muhlleitner, Milada Margarete"]}

{"title":"Vector meson dominance, axial anomaly and the thermal behavior of g (rho omega pi) (T)","abstract":"By using a thermal Finite Energy QCD Sum Rule, we are able to establish the temperature dependence of the $g_{\\omega \\rho \\pi}(T)$ strong coupling. It turns out that this coupling decreases as a function of temperature, vanishing at the critical temperature. This corresponds to a possible deconfining phenomenological signal. This result, together with the Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) expression for the amplitude $\\pi ^{0} \\to \\gamma \\gamma $, allows us to establish that this amplitude also vanishes at the critical temperature, in agreement with previous independent analysis. This results supports, once again, the validity of VMD at finite temperature. Several posssible scenarios are discussed. However, if VMD would not hold at finite temperature, then we will not be able to find a prediction for the thermal behavior of the $\\pi ^{0} \\to \\gamma \\gamma $ amplitude.","created":"2000-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":5,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Montpellier 2000/07/06"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling constant: (omega(783) rho(770) pi)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sum rule: finite energy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector dominance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anomaly: axial"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi0: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"amplitude analysis: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena: confinement"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Dominguez, C.A.","Loewe, M."]}

This approach gives the form factors as relativistic double spectral representations in terms of the wave functions of the initial and final mesons. The form factors have the correct analytic properties and satisfy general requirements of nonperturbative QCD in the heavy quark limit. The effective quark masses and meson wave functions are determined by fitting the quark model parameters to lattice QCD results for the $B\\to \\rho$ transition form factors at large momentum transfers and to the measured $D\\to (K,K^*)l\\nu$ decay rates.

We adequately describe the experimental meson and lattice glueball spectra and perform the first relativistic, three quasiparticle calculation for hybrid mesons. In general agreement with alternative theoretical approaches, we predict the lightest hybrid states near but above 2 GeV, indicating the two recently observed $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$ exotics at 1.4 and 1.6 GeV are of a different, perhaps four quark, structure.

The target rest frame and the color dipole formulation are employed. Multiple scatterings are treated in Glauber-Gribov theory, which is modified to include the nuclear form factor to all orders. Based on the mean coherence length, which is defined in this work, it is estimated that gluon shadowing is negligible at x_{Bj}>0.01. Parameter free calculations are compared to NMC and E665 data for DIS and to E772 data for DY. In both cases, good agreement is found. It is however not possible to reproduce the effect observed by HERMES. For dileptons in proton-nucleus collisions at RHIC energies, considerable shadowing for the whole x_F range is predicted.

On the other hand if one wants to use dimensional regularization throughout, then one needs all scales to be included within the matrix element, and this results in the same net effect.

{"title":"The Directional rate and the modulation effect for direct supersymmetric matter detection","abstract":"The detection of the theoretically expected dark matter is central to particle physics and cosmology. Current fashionable supersymmetric models provide a natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like the quark substructure of the nucleon and the nuclear structure (form factor and/or spin response function), permit the evaluation of the event rate for LSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however, very low. So it is imperative to exploit the modulation effect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the earth's annual motion. Also it is useful to consider the directional rate, i.e its dependence on the direction of the recoiling nucleus. In this paper we study the modulation effect both in non directional and directional experiments. We calculate both the differential and the total rates usingi both isothermal, symmetric as well as only axially asymmetric, and non isothermal, due to caustic rings, velocity distributions. We consider We find that in the symmetric case the modulation amplitude is small. The same is true for the case of caustic rings. The inclusion of asymmetry, with a enhanced velocity dispersion in the galactocentric direction, yields an enhanced modulation effect, especially in directional experiments.","created":"2000-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":34,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Dubna 2000/07/19"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmic radiation: time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"elastic scattering: sparticle nucleus"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"LSP: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"asymmetry: axial"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"velocity: dispersion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Ioannina 2000/04/20"}],"num_refs":86,"citation_count":30,"authors":["Vergados, J.D."]}

Such regions can survive the annihilation with surrounding matter only in the case if their sizes exceeds the critical surviving size. The evolution of survived antimatter - regions with high original antibaryon density inside results in the formation of globular clusters, which is made out from antimatter stars. The origin of antimatter regions in the chosen scenario is accompanied the formation of closed domain walls, which can collapse into massive black holes deposed inside the high density antimatter regions. This fact can give us an additional hint, that an anti - stars globular cluster could be one of the collapsed - core star clusters, which populate our galaxy.","created":"2000-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"cosmology"},{"source":"author","value":"antimatter"},{"source":"author","value":"baryon production"},{"source":"author","value":"star formation"},{"source":"author","value":"star clusters"},{"source":"author","value":"black holes"},{"source":"author","value":"topology"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Verbier 2000/07/17"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"antibaryon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"domain wall"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: cluster"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"defect: topological"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"black hole"}],"num_refs":14,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Sakharov, Alexander","Khlopov, Maxim","Rubin, Sergei"]}

{"title":"Dark matter in supergravity","abstract":"We consider neutralino-proton cross sections for halo dark matter neutralinos within the framework of supergravity models with R-parity invariance for models with universal soft breaking (mSUGRA) and models with nonuniversal soft breaking. The analysis includes the necessary corrections to treat the large tanbeta region (i.e. L-R mixing in the squark and slepton mass matrices, loop corrections to the b and tau masses,etc) and includes all coannihilation phenomena. For mSUGRA, dark matter detectors with current sensitivity are seen to be probing the region where tanbeta>~25, Omega h^2 <0.1, m_{chi_1^0}~<90 GeV, and for the light Higgs, m_h~< 120 GeV. Nonuniversal models can have a much larger cross section, and current detectors can probe part of the parameter space where tan>~4. Minimum cross sections are generally greater than 10^{-9} pb to 10^{-10} pb for m_{1/2} <600 GeV (and hence accessible to planned future detectors), with the exception of a region when mu <0 where for m_{1/2}>~450 GeV, 4~< tanbeta~<20, the cross section drops to a minimum of about 1\\times10^{-12} pb at m_{1/2}=600 GeV, tan beta=~10.

It is shown that the current accurate data on the Fermi constant and on other electro-weak parameters puts a lower bound on the scale of extra dimensions of $\\sim$ 3 TeV, and thus the observation of such dimensions lies beyond the reach of accelerators in the near future. The correction to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon from extra dimensions is discussed and one finds that with the current limit on the scale of extra dimensions from the Fermi constant, the correction to $g_{\\mu}-2$ does not compete with the potentially large contributions from the supersymmetric electro-weak correction. The possibility of generating Kaluza-Klein excitations associated with large radius compactifications at the LHC is discussed. It is shown that if such excitations are indeed produced their resonance structure will encode information on the number of compactified dimensions as well as on the nature of the specific orbifold compactification. A brief discussion of difficulties such as rapid proton decay that one encounters in theories with large radius compactifications is given.","created":"2000-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Dubna 2000/07/19"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model: excited state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: magnetic moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"weak interaction: coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"compactification"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum gravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":95,"citation_count":10,"authors":["Nath, Pran"]}

These solutions may be used for describing more wide spectrum of hadron excitations and for the quantization of this nonlinear system.

{"title":"The MSSM electroweak phase transition","abstract":"When the Minimally Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is placed in an environment with a finite temperature T���100���GeV, the electroweak symmetry gets restored. Depending on the parameter values, this can happen either via a first order phase transition, or an analytic crossover. If there is a phase transition which is sufficiently strong of the first order, important cosmological remnants could be produced, such as a baryon asymmetry. In this talk I review which part of the MSSM parameter space is consistent both with cosmological baryon asymmetry generation and with existing experimental data.","created":"2001-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"cosmology"},{"source":"author","value":"phase transformations"},{"source":"author","value":"supersymmetry"},{"source":"author","value":"unified field theories"},{"source":"author","value":"elementary particle mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Verbier 2000/07/17"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"standard model: supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: top"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Laine, M."]}

It is demonstrated that, contrary to the s-wave production where loops enter at too low an order to allow the scheme predictive power, there are certain p-wave observables where parameter free predictions are possible. These predictions are consistent with experimental data. We show that the investigation of charged pion production yields a constraint on a contribution to the three-nucleon force with a spin-isospin structure that could resolve the Ay puzzle in nd scattering.","created":"2006-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":2,"num_refs":15,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Hanhart, C."]}

They are extracted from Data obtained with the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW, which operates five enriched 76Ge detectors in an extreme low-level environment in the GRAN SASSO. The two neutrino accompanied double beta decay is evaluated for the first time for all five detectors with a statistical significance of 47.7 kg y resulting in a half life of (T_(1/2))^(2nu) = [1.55 +- 0.01 (stat) (+0.19) (-0.15) (syst)] x 10^(21) years. The lower limit on the half-life of the 0nu beta-beta decay obtained with pulse shape analysis is (T_(1/2))^(0_nu) > 1.9 x 10^(25) [3.1 x 10^(25)] years with 90% C.L. (68% C.L.) (with 35.5 kg y). This results in an upper limit of the effective Majorana neutrino mass of 0.35 eV (0.27 eV). No evidence for a Majoron emitting decay mode or for the neutrinoless mode is observed.","created":"2014-01-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Heidelberg 2000/07/10"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"double-beta decay: (2neutrino)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"double-beta decay: (0neutrino)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"germanium: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lower limit"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"upper limit"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"semiconductor detector: germanium"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Gran Sasso"}],"num_refs":51,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Klapdor-Kleingrothaus, H.V.","Dietz, A.","Baudis, L.","Heusser, G.","Krivosheina, I.V.","Kolb, S.","Majorovits, B.","Pas, H.","Strecker, H.","Alexeev, V.","Balysh, A.","Bakalyarov, A.","Belyaev, S.T.","Lebedev, V.I.","Zhukov, S."]}

Examples that I will describe include deep inelastic scattering from deuterium at SLAC and elastic scattering from 12 C at Bates. Recently, the focus has shifted to the search for strange form factors in the elastic scattering from hydrogen. I will present recent results on the subject from the HAPPEX collaboration at JLab.

Charged Higgs is the distinguished signature of new physics, in this report, I review my two works on charged Higgs associated production with top quark and $W$ boson at hardron colliders. Our researches show that these two charged Higgs production mechanisms are important channel not only in finding charged Higgs, but also in studying the quantum structure of new physics. Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) processes are forbidden at tree level in the Standard Model (SM), so they act as the ground to test quantum structure of the SM and also very important channel in finding new physics beyond the SM. In this report, I focus on the studies on FCNC processes on linear colliders and in B-factories.","created":"2000-06-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":143,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: charged particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: associated production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: charm"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: associated production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: strangeness"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"doublet: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular distribution: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: rare decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":209,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Zhu, Shou Hua"]}

{"title":"Unbroken versus broken mirror world: A Tale of two vacua","abstract":"If the Lagrangian of nature respects parity invariance then there are two distinct possibilities: either parity is unbroken by the vacuum or it is spontaneously broken. We examine the two simplest phenomenologically consistent gauge models which have unbroken and spontaneously broken parity symmetries, respectively. These two models have a Lagrangian of the same form, but a different parameter range is chosen in the Higgs potential. They both predict the existence of dark matter and can explain the MACHO events. However, the models predict quite different neutrino physics. Although both have light mirror (effectively sterile) neutrinos, the ordinary-mirror neutrino mixing angles are unobservably tiny in the broken parity case. The minimal broken parity model therefore cannot simultaneously explain the solar, atmospheric and LSND data. By contrast, the unbroken parity version can explain all of the neutrino anomalies. Furthermore, we argue that the unbroken case provides the most natural explanation of the neutrino physics anomalies (irrespective of whether evidence from the LSND experiment is included) because of its characteristic maximal mixing prediction.","created":"2000-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mirror particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Lagrangian formalism"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: Higgs"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"MACHO"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":59,"citation_count":48,"authors":["Foot, Robert","Lew, H.","Volkas, R.R."]}

{"title":"Quark hadron continuity in QCD with one flavor","abstract":"We study QCD with one flavor at finite baryon density. In the limit of very high baryon density the system is expected to be a color superconductor. In the case of one flavor, the order parameter is in a $\\bar 3$ of color and has total angular momentum one. We show that in weak coupling perturbation theory, the energetically preferred phase exhibits ``color-spin-locking'', i.e. the color and spin direction of the condensate are aligned. We discuss the properties of this phase and argue that it shares important features of the hadronic phase at low density. In particular, we find an unbroken rotational symmetry, spin 3/2 quasiparticles, and an unusual mechanism for quark-anti-quark condensation. Our results are relevant to three flavor QCD in the regime where the strange quark mass is bigger than the critical value for color-flavor-locking.

{"title":"Experimental probes of localized gravity: On and off the wall","abstract":"The phenomenology of the Randall-Sundrum model of localized gravity is analyzed in detail for the two scenarios where the Standard Model (SM) gauge and matter fields are either confined to a TeV scale 3-brane or may propagate in a slice of five dimensional anti-deSitter space. In the latter instance, we derive the interactions of the graviton, gauge, and fermion Kaluza-Klein (KK) states. The resulting phenomenological signatures are shown to be highly dependent on the value of the 5-dimensional fermion mass and differ substantially from the case where the SM fields lie on the TeV-brane. In both scenarios, we examine the collider signatures for direct production of the graviton and gauge KK towers as well as their induced contributions to precision electroweak observables. These direct and indirect signatures are found to play a complementary role in the exploration of the model parameter space. In the case where the SM field content resides on the TeV-brane, we show that the LHC can probe the full parameter space and hence will either discover or exclude this model if the scale of electroweak physics on the 3-brane is less than 10 TeV.

Moreover, all fields are protected by chirality and supersymmetry from acquiring high scale masses. The additional requirements of anomaly cancellation and gauge coupling unification imply the existence of extra matter multiplets and that several fields participate in U(1)' symmetry breaking simultaneously. While there are several studies addressing subsets of these requirements, this work uncovers simultaneous solutions to all of them. It is surprising and encouraging that extending the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model by a simple U(1) factor solves its major drawbacks with respect to the non-supersymmetric Standard Model, especially as current precision data seem to offer a hint to the existence of its corresponding Z' boson. It is also remarkable that there are many solutions where the U(1)' charges of the known quarks and leptons are predicted to be identical to those E_6 motivated Z' bosons which give the best fit to the data.

{"title":"Inhomogeneous nucleation in quark hadron phase transition","abstract":"The effect of subcritical hadron bubbles on a first-order quark-hadron phase transition is studied. These subcritical hadron bubbles are created due to thermal fluctuations, and can introduce a finite amount of phase mixing (quark phase mixed with hadron phase) even at and above the critical temperature. For reasonable choices of surface tension and correlation length, as obtained from the lattice QCD calculations, we show that the amount of phase mixing at the critical temperature remains below the percolation threshold. Thus, as the system cools below the critical temperature, the transition proceeds through the nucleation of critical-size hadron bubbles from a metastable quark-gluon phase (QGP), within an inhomogeneous background populated by an equilibrium distribution of subcritical hadron bubbles. The inhomogeneity of the medium results in a substantial reduction of the nucleation barrier for critical bubbles. Using the corrected nucleation barrier, we estimate the amount of supercooling for different parameters controlling the phase transition, and briefly discuss its implications to cosmology and heavy-ion collisions.","created":"2000-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena: quark hadron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: bubble"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential: parametrization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature: time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":32,"citation_count":12,"authors":["Shukla, Prashant","Mohanty, A.K.","Gupta, S.K.","Gleiser, Marcelo"]}

We do this explicitly when two terms beyond the leading order (NNLO, $\\sim \\alpha_s^3$) are known in the truncated perturbation series (TPS). At first, the scheme dependence shows up as a dependence on the first two scheme parameters $c_2$ and $c_3$. Invariance under the change of the leading parameter $c_2$ is achieved via a variant of the principle of minimal sensitivity. The subleading parameter $c_3$ is fixed so that a scale- and scheme-invariant Borel transform of the resummation approximant gives the correct location of the leading infrared renormalon pole. The leading higher-twist contribution, or a part of it, is thus believed to be contained implicitly in the resummation. We applied the approximant to the Bjorken polarized sum rule (BjPSR) at $Q^2_{\\rm ph}=5$ and $3 GeV^2$, for the most recent data and the data available until 1997, respectively, and obtained ${\\alpha}_s^{\\bar MS}(M_Z^2)=0.119^{+0.003}_{-0.006}$ and $0.113^{+0.004}_{-0.019}$, respectively.

However, the quasiparticles in a plasma are characterized by having a finite lifetime. In this article we take into account this fact to evaluate its effect in the computation of the color gap. By first considering the Schwinger-Dyson equations in weak coupling, when one-loop self-energy corrections are included, a general gap equation is written in terms of the spectral densities of the quasiparticles. To evaluate lifetime effects, we then model the spectral density by a Lorentzian function. We argue that the decay of the quasiparticles limits their efficiency to condense. The value of the gap at the Fermi surface is then reduced. To leading order, these lifetime effects can be taken into account by replacing the coupling constant of the gap equation by a reduced effective one.","created":"2000-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: weak coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"superconductivity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dyson-Schwinger equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: pseudoparticle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: gap"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spectral representation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":22,"citation_count":43,"authors":["Manuel, Cristina"]}

The stability condition for a nucleon and the recently extracted nucleon $\\Sigma_N$ term are used to estimate the radius of the soliton. It is found that 0.67 fm $\\le R \\le$ 0.78 fm.

{"title":"Supersymmetric electroweak baryogenesis","abstract":"We re-examine the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) during the electroweak phase transition. We find that the dominant source for baryogenesis arises from the chargino sector. The CP-violation comes from the complex phase in the mu parameter, which provides CP-odd contributions to the particle dispersion relations. This leads to different accelerations for particles and antiparticles in the wall region which, combined with diffusion, leads to the separation of Higgsinos and their antiparticles in the front of the wall. These asymmetries get transported to produce perturbations in the left-handed chiral quarks, which then drive sphaleron interactions to create the baryon asymmetry. We present a complete derivation of the semiclassical WKB formalism, including the chargino dispersion relations and a self-consistent derivation of the diffusion equations starting from semiclassical Boltzmann equations for WKB-excitations. We stress the advantages of treating the transport equations in terms of the manifestly gauge invariant physical energy and kinetic momentum, rather than in the gauge variant canonical variables used in previous treatments. We show that a large enough baryon asymmetry can be created for the phase of the complex mu parameter as small as ~ 0.001, which is consistent with bounds from the neutron electric dipole moment.","created":"2000-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":54,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"chargino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dispersion relation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"WKB approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transport theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"diffusion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Boltzmann equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"velocity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":70,"citation_count":249,"authors":["Cline, James M.","Joyce, Michael","Kainulainen, Kimmo"]}

We concentrate on radial flow and the elliptic flow coefficient v2 as functions of the impact parameter and of the collision energy. We demonstrate that the finally observed elliptic flow is established earlier in the collision than the observed radial flow and thus probes the equation of state at higher energy densities. We point out that a phase transition from hadronic matter to a color-deconfined quark-gluon plasma leads to non-monotonic behaviour in both beam energy and impact parameter dependences which, if observed, can be used to identify such a phase transition. Our calculations span collision energies from the Brookhaven AGS (Alternating Gradient Synchrotron) to beyond the LHC (Large Hadron Collider); the QGP phase transition signature is predicted between the lowest available SPS (CERN Super Proton Synchrotron) and the highest RHIC (Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) energies.

{"title":"The Earth regeneration effect of solar neutrinos: A Numerical treatment with three active neutrino flavors","abstract":"We introduce an integrated algorithm for full scale investigation of the earth regeneration effect of solar neutrinos with all three active neutrinos. We illustrate that the earth effect on low energy solar neutrinos ($E_\\nu < 20$ MeV) causes large variations in the survival probabilities for large values of the mixing angle $\\theta_{12}$ for a given value of $\\theta_{13}$. But it is maximal for small values of $\\theta_{13}$ and diminishes for large values at a given value of $\\theta_{12}$. The nadir angle dependence is sensitive to the value of $E'\\equiv E/\\Delta_{12}$. As far as low energy solar neutrinos are concerned we notice that the earth effect is more pronounced for core penetration. We confirm that the earth effect leaves the SMA region almost intact regardless of $\\theta_{13}$ and that it is significant for high energy $^8$B and $hep$ neutrinos in the LMA region. We also show that for large values of $\\theta_{13}$, the earth effect is significant for high energy neutrinos ($E'\\gtrsim 10^9$) and it can be large at any nadir angle.","created":"2000-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flux"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"geophysics: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":82,"citation_count":6,"authors":["Kim, Jai Sam","Lee, Kyungsoo"]}

We concentrate on class of models with integer U(1) charges chosen to reproduce the quark masses and mixings as well as charged lepton masses exactly or approximately. The U(1) charges are further restricted by the requirement that very large bilinear lepton number violating terms should not be allowed in the superpotential. It is shown that this leads to severely constrained patterns of trilinear interactions. Specifically, only choice compatible with phenomenological restrictions is the one in which all the trilinear $\\lambda'_{ijk}$ and all but at most two trilinear $\\lambda_{ijk}$ couplings vanish or are enormously suppressed. The U(1) symmetry can allow effective generation of bilinear lepton number violating parameters through terms in the Kahler potential. Resulting models are identified and structure of neutrino masses in some of these is briefly discussed.","created":"2000-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"horizontal symmetry: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"}],"num_refs":28,"citation_count":41,"authors":["Joshipura, Anjan S.","Vaidya, Rishikesh D.","Vempati, Sudhir K."]}

This generalizes the previously studied case of a Poissonian input multiplicity distribution. In the general case we find interesting residual correlations which require a modified framework for extracting information on the source geometry from two-particle correlation measurements. In sources with high phase-space densities, multi-boson effects modify the Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) radius parameters and simultaneously generate strong residual correlations. We clarify their effect on the correlation strength (intercept parameter) and thus explain a variety of previously reported puzzling multi-boson symmetrization phenomena. Using a class of analytically solvable Gaussian source models, with and without space-momentum correlations, we present a comprehensive overview of multi-boson symmetrization effects on particle interferometry. For event ensembles of (approximately) fixed multiplicity, the residual correlations lead to a minimum in the correlation function at non-zero relative momentum, which can be practically exploited to search, in a model-independent way, for multi-boson symmetrization effects in high-energy heavy-ion experiments.","created":"2000-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"multiple production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation function: two-particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boson: statistics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Hanbury-Brown-Twiss effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: multiple production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"multiplicity: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"kinematics: phase space"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"statistical analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":59,"citation_count":17,"authors":["Heinz, Ulrich W.","Scotto, Pierre","Zhang, Qing-Hui"]}

Besides that, it turns out that such a screening leads also to the appearance of the long-range contribution to one of the two coefficient functions, which parametrize the bilocal correlator within the Stochastic Vacuum Model.

Flavours other than electron-type neutrinos may be produced, for example, by the annihilation of WIMPs which may be trapped inside the Sun. In the GeV energy regime, matter effects are important both for the ``1-3'' system and the ``1-2'' system, and for different neutrino mass hierarchies. A numerical scan of the multidimensional three-flavour parameter space is performed, ``inspired'' by the current experimental situation. One important result is that, in the three-flavour oscillation case, P{alpha,beta} is different from P{beta,alpha} for a significant portion of the parameter space, even if there is no CP-violating phase in the MNS matrix. Furthermore, P{mu,mu} has a significantly different behaviour from P{tau,tau}, which may affect expectations for the number of events detected at large neutrino telescopes.","created":"2000-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":39,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flux"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"antineutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":56,"citation_count":24,"authors":["de Gouvea, Andre"]}

{"title":"Low-energy limits of theories with two supersymmetries","abstract":"Given its non-renormalization properties, low-energy supersymmetry provides an attractive framework for extending the Standard Model and for resolving the hierarchy problem. Models with softly broken N =1 supersymmetry were extensively studied and are phenomenologically successful. However, it could be that an extended N = 2 supersymmetry survives to low energies, as suggested by various constructions. We examine the phenomenological viability and implications of such a scenario. We show that consistent chiral fermion mass generation emerges in N=2 theories, which are vectorial, as a result of supersymmetry breaking at low energies. A rich mirror quark and lepton spectrum near the weak scale with model-dependent decay modes is predicted. A Z_{2} mirror parity is shown to play an important role in determining the phenomenology of the models. It leads, if conserved, to a new stable particle, the LMP. Consistency of the N=2 framework and its unique spectrum with electroweak precision data is considered, and the discovery potential in the next generation of hadron collider experiments is stressed. Mirror quark pair production provides the most promising discovery channel. Higgs searches are also discussed and it is shown that there is no upper bound on the prediction for the Higgs boson mass in the framework of low-energy supersymmetry breaking, in general, and in the N=2 framework, in particular.

{"title":"Monopoles, axions and intermediate mass dark matter","abstract":"We present a solution to the cosmological problem encountered in (supersymmetric) grand unified theories due to copious monopole production at the end of hybrid inflation. By employing thermal inflation ``driven'' by the U(1) axion symmetry, the superheavy monopole flux can be naturally suppressed to values that should be accessible to dedicated large scale experiments. The U(1) axion symmetry also helps generate the right magnitude for the mu term of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. An important by-product is the predicted existence of stable or very long-living fermions possessing intermediate scale masses of order 10^{12} GeV.

We show here that different pictures of the short-distance structure of space-time would lead to different manifestations of Lorentz-invariance violation. Specifically, the deformation of Lorentz invariance needed to resolve these observational paradoxes can only arise within commutative short-distance pictures of space-time. In noncommutative space-times there is no anomalous effect, at least at leading order. Also exploiting the fact that arrival-time delays between high energy photons with different energies would arise in both the commutative and the noncommutative Lorentz-violation pictures, we describe an experimental programme, based on time-of-arrival analysis of high energy photons and searches of violations of GZK and TeV-photon limits, which could discriminate between alternative scenarios of Lorentz-invariance breakdown and could provide and unexpected window on the (quantum) nature of space-time at very short distances.","created":"2000-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmic radiation: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum gravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"invariance: Lorentz"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: space-time"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":32,"citation_count":86,"authors":["Amelino-Camelia, Giovanni","Piran, Tsvi"]}

In the case where the gauge bosons propagate in a bulk of a certain volume, this composite Higgs doublet can successfully trigger electroweak symmetry breaking. The mass of the top quark is correctly predicted to within 20%, without the need to add a fundamental Yukawa interaction, and the Higgs boson mass is predicted to lie in the range 165 - 230 GeV.

We effect a new determination of the octet and 27-plet coupling constants with strong-interaction isospin violation and with electromagnetic effects, as computed by Cirigliano, Donoghue, and Golowich, and find that we are unable to resolve the difficulty. Exploring the role of |Delta I|=5/2 transitions in the CP-violating observable epsilon'/epsilon, we determine that the presence of a |Delta I|=5/2 amplitude impacts the empirical determination of omega, the ratio of the real parts of the |Delta I|=3/2 to |Delta I|=1/2 amplitudes, and that it generates a decrease in the estimation of epsilon'/epsilon.","created":"2000-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"isospin: selection rule"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"isospin: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"amplitude analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unitarity: constraint"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partial wave analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":41,"citation_count":32,"authors":["Gardner, Susan","Valencia, G."]}

The 1/m_Q corrections to the scaling law f_M \\sim F/\\sqrt{m_M} are found to be small in HQEFT, which demonstrates again the validity of 1/m_Q expansion in HQEFT.

The calculations presented in this paper provide a consistent check on the HQEFT and shows that the HQEFT is more reliable than the usual HQET for describing a slightly off-mass shell heavy quark within hadron as the usual HQET seems to lead to the breakdown of 1/m_Q expansion in evaluating the meson decay constants.

{"title":"Resumming the large N approximation for time evolving quantum systems","abstract":"In this paper we discuss two methods of resumming the leading and next to leading order in 1/N diagrams for the quartic O(N) model. These two approaches have the property that they preserve both boundedness and positivity for expectation values of operators in our numerical simulations. These approximations can be understood either in terms of a truncation to the infinitely coupled Schwinger-Dyson hierarchy of equations, or by choosing a particular two-particle irreducible vacuum energy graph in the effective action of the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis formalism. We confine our discussion to the case of quantum mechanics where the Lagrangian is $L(x,\\dot{x}) = (1/2) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\dot{x}_i^2 - (g/8N) [ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2 - r_0^2 ]^{2}$. The key to these approximations is to treat both the $x$ propagator and the $x^2$ propagator on similar footing which leads to a theory whose graphs have the same topology as QED with the $x^2$ propagator playing the role of the photon. The bare vertex approximation is obtained by replacing the exact vertex function by the bare one in the exact Schwinger-Dyson equations for the one and two point functions. The second approximation, which we call the dynamic Debye screening approximation, makes the further approximation of replacing the exact $x^2$ propagator by its value at leading order in the 1/N expansion. These two approximations are compared with exact numerical simulations for the quantum roll problem. The bare vertex approximation captures the physics at large and modest $N$ better than the dynamic Debye screening approximation.","created":"2000-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":30,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum mechanics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"oscillator: nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: O(N)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dyson-Schwinger equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state: energy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vertex function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"screening: Debye"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":49,"citation_count":55,"authors":["Mihaila, Bogdan","Cooper, Fred","Dawson, John F."]}

We find that the positions of the 3-branes required to solve the gauge hierachy problem simultaneously reproduces phenomenologically acceptable fermion masses and mixings.","created":"2000-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: interference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Randall-Sundrum model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: infinite"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hierarchy: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":26,"citation_count":4,"authors":["Dooling, David","Kang, Kyungsik"]}

The effective longitudinal pressure is found to remain significantly below the lattice QCD pressure with these initial conditions until the plasma cools to near the confinement scale. The absolute value of the transverse energy per unit of rapidity and its dependence on beam energy is shown to provide a sensitive test of gluon saturation models since the fractional transverse energy loss due to final state interactions is predicted to be much smaller and exhibit a weaker energy dependence than nondissipative hydrodynamics applied throughout the evolution.","created":"2000-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":6,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Mh"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"24.85.+p"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"25.75.-q"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.85.-t"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"asymptotic freedom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"entropy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: minijet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":39,"citation_count":49,"authors":["Dumitru, Adrian","Gyulassy, Miklos"]}

The interactions and decay of such neutrinos determine their decoupling epoch during the evolution of the universe. This in turn affects various observable features like the energy density, nucleosynthesis, CMBR spectrum, galaxy formation, and baryogenesis. Here, we consider reduction of right-handed electron-type Majorana neutrinos, in the left-right symmetric model, by the WR+ - WR- channel and the channel originating from an anomaly, involving the SU(2)R gauge group, as well as decay of such neutrinos. We study the reduction of these neutrinos for different ranges of left-right model parameters, and find that, if the neutrino mass exceeds the right-handed gauge boson mass, then the neutrinos never decouple for realistic values of the parameters, but, rather, decay in equilibrium. Because there is no out-of-equilibrium decay, no mass bounds can be set for the neutrinos.","created":"2000-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: left-right"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Boltzmann equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":51,"citation_count":9,"authors":["Adhya, Paramita","Chaudhuri, D.

When the radion field is time-independent and the inter-brane spacing is stabilized, the universe can naturally find itself in the radiation-dominated epoch. This feature is independent of the form of the stabilizing potential. We recover the standard Friedmann equations without assuming a specific form for the bulk energy-momentum tensor. In the models considered, if the observable brane has positive tension, a solution to the hierarchy problem requires the presence of a negative tension brane somewhere in the bulk. We find that the string scale can be as low as the electroweak scale. In the situation of self-tuning branes where the bulk cosmological constant is set to zero, the brane tensions have hierarchical values.

There exist models that answer the first challenge by using singlet bulk neutrinos coupled to the standard model in the brane. Our goal in this paper is to see to what extent the simplest versions of these models can answer the second challenge. Our conclusion is that the minimal framework that has no new physics beyond the above simple picture cannot simultaneously explain solar, atmospheric and LSND data, whereas there are several ways that it can accommodate the first two. This would suggest that confirmation of LSND data would indicate the existence of new physics either in the brane or in extra dimensions or both, if indeed it turns out that there are large extra dimensions.","created":"2000-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.60.Pq"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.60.St"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.10.Kk"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum gravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: space-time"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":34,"citation_count":93,"authors":["Mohapatra, R.N.","Perez-Lorenzana, Abdel"]}

The asymmetry is therefore difficult to distinguish experimentally from the Standard Model (SM) value, which is also small. The cancellation mechanism is found to be rendered inoperative in supersymmetry due to the presence of chargino loops. Unlike b to s gamma, the rate asymmetry for b to d gamma in Higgs models can be quite different from its SM value, generally ranging from -20% to +20%. Specific model calculations are performed for the Three-Higgs Doublet Model and the ``Top'' Two-Higgs Doublet Model to serve as illustrations.

A comparison of the many-body solution to our model and the constituent quark model demonstrates that the quark model is sufficiently flexible to describe meson hyperfine splitting provided proper renormalization conditions and correct degrees of freedom are employed consistently.","created":"2000-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":6,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Hamiltonian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pseudoscalar meson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":29,"citation_count":39,"authors":["Szczepaniak, Adam P.","Swanson, Eric S."]}

We give analytical results for the non-factorizable virtual corrections and express the factorizable virtual corrections in terms of the known corrections to on-shell W-pair production and W decay. The calculation of the bremsstrahlung corrections, i.e. the processes e+e- --> 4f+gamma in lowest order, is based on the full matrix elements. The matching of soft and collinear singularities between virtual and real corrections is done alternatively in two different ways, namely by using a subtraction method and by applying phase-space slicing. The O(alpha) corrections as well as higher-order initial-state photon radiation are implemented in the Monte Carlo generator RACOONWW. Numerical results of this program are presented for the W-pair-production cross section, angular and W-invariant-mass distributions at LEP2.

For heterotic orbifolds/type IIB orientifolds, this shows that the lowest order K��hler term of the dilaton has the structure ��� ln (S+ S ) in agreement with string calculations. The structure of the holomorphic coupling is also found from arguments of unification and anomaly cancellation under the conjectured SL(2,Z) T i symmetries of the models. A consequence of the latter is that in the case of the Z 3 orientifold the holomorphic coupling necessarily contains a part with coefficient proportional to the one loop beta function, in agreement with string calculations which do not however assume this symmetry. This gives circumstantial evidence for the existence of this symmetry at string level in Z 3 orientifold. Finally, we comment on the values of the unification scale and examine the possibility of mirage unification in which the effective unification scale may be situated far above the string scale.","created":"2000-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supergravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"orbifold: heterotic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"orientifold: Z(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"compactification"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anomaly"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: Kaehler"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dilaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unified field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"}],"num_refs":31,"citation_count":4,"authors":["Ghilencea, Dumitru M.","Ross, Graham G."]}

Within this approach, nuclear broadening should be treated as color filtering, i.e. absorption of large-size dipoles leading to diminishing (enlarged) transverse separation (momentum). We also present a more intuitive derivation based on the classic scattering theory of Moli\\`ere. This derivation helps to understand the origin of the dipole cross section, part of which comes from attenuation of the quark, while another part is due to multiple interactions of the quark. It also demonstrates that the lowest-order rescattering term provides an A-dependence very different from the generally accepted A^{1/3} behavior. The effect of broadening increases with energy, and we evaluate it using different phenomenological models for the unintegrated gluon density.

{"title":"Ultrahigh-energy neutrinos and the highest energy cosmic rays","abstract":"It has been suggested that the characteristic energy of string models may be considerably lower than the observed Planck mass. In such schemes, the unification of interactions takes place around the string scale, perhaps as low as a few tens of TeV. Consequently, at energies above the string scale, neutrinos acquire interactions comparable in strength to strong interactions. While they can propagate through the CMBR essentially uninhibited, in interactions with nuclei in the atmosphere they induce air showers comparable to proton induced ones. We conjecture that air showers above the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff in the cosmic radiation are induced by such neutrinos. A Monte Carlo simulation shows that neutrino induced \"anomalous\" showers are virtually indistinguishable from proton induced ones on an event-by event basis. However, given sufficient statistics in detectors (HiRes, OWL, Auger etc.), the post-GZK showers are expected to exhibit characteristics in the fluctuation pattern allowing a distinction between proton and neutrino induced showers.","created":"2000-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Sudbury 2000/06"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unified field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: strong interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino nucleus: nuclear reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"showers: air"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmic background radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"showers: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"}],"num_refs":19,"citation_count":29,"authors":["Domokos, G.","Kovesi-Domokos, S.","Mikulski, Paul T."]}

The large N limit of N-component vector models, and the usual semiclassical limit of point particle quantum mechanics are used as concrete examples. Our formulation directly exploits the appropriate group structure which underlies the construction of suitable coherent states and generates the classical phase space.

We present non-perturbative analysis of this phenomenon over a 6-dimensional parameter space in an expanding background paying particular attention to the interplay between instant and direct fermion preheating. In the broad resonance regime we find that instant fermion production is sensitive to suppression of the long wavelength scalar field modes during inflation. Further, the standard scenario of resonant fermionic preheating through inflaton decay can be significantly modified by instant preheating, and may even lead to a decrease in the number of fermions produced. We explicitly include the effects of metric perturbations and demonstrate that they are important at small coupling but not at strong coupling, due to the rapid saturation of the Pauli bound.","created":"2000-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"chaos"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"preheating"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"multiple"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"resonance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflaton: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion number: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":74,"citation_count":37,"authors":["Tsujikawa, Shinji","Bassett, Bruce A.","Viniegra, Fermin"]}

This model includes all light two-pseudoscalar thresholds, constraints from Adler zeroes, flavour symmetric couplings, unitarity and physically acceptable analyticity. One finds that with a large coupling there can appear two physical resonance poles on the second sheet although only one bare quark-antiquark state is put in. The f0(980) and f0(1370) resonance poles are thus in this model two manifestations of the same strange-antistrange quark state. On the other hand, the isoscalar state containing u and d quarks becomes (when unitarized and strongly distorted by hadronic mass shifts) a very broad resonance, with its pole at 470-i250 MeV. This is the sigma meson required by models for spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry.","created":"2000-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":6,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"conference summary"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kyoto 2000/06/12"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar meson: hadron spectroscopy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pseudoscalar meson: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partial wave analysis: coupled channel"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"f0(600): mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"a0(980)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K*0(1430)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":13,"citation_count":18,"authors":["Tornqvist, Nils A."]}

{"title":"The Many sources effect on the genuine multi - hadron correlations","abstract":"Here we report on a study aimed to explore the dependence of the genuine multiparticle correlations on the number of sources while the influence of other possible factors affecting the multihadron production is avoided. The analysis utilised the normalised cumulants, calculated in three-dimensional phase space, of the reaction e+e- -> Z -> hadrons using a large Monte Carlo event sample. The multi-sources reactions were simulated by overlaying a few independent single e+e- annihilation events. It was found that as the number of sources S increases, the cumulants do not change significantly their structure, but those of an order q>2 (i.e. more than 2 pions) decrease fast in their magnitude. This reduction can be understood in termsof combinatorial considerations of source mixing which dilutes the correlations by a factor of about 1/S^{q-1} which can also serve as a method to estimated the number of sources. This expected suppression is well reproduced by recent cumulant measurements in hadron and nucleus induced reactions both in one (rapidity) and two (rapidity vs. azimuthal angle) dimensions. The diminishing genuine correlations effect should also appear in other dynamical correlations like the Bose-Einstein in e+e- -> W+W- -> hadrons and in nucleus-nucleus reactions.","created":"2000-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Torino 2000/06/12"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: multiple production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation: ((n)hadron)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cumulant expansion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rapidity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus nucleus: nuclear reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: OPAL"}],"num_refs":37,"citation_count":12,"authors":["Alexander, Gideon","Sarkisian, Edward"]}

However most are devoted to inclusive decays and productions. Experimental data of several two-body exclusive decay channels of P-wave charmonia such as \\pi \\pi and p \\bar p are available and some have recently been re-measured by the BES collaboration. It is not clear from the outset that color octet is needed for these exclusive channels. Indeed only color singlet has been used in the past and reasonable agreement with data was found.

{"title":"Glue in the light front pion","abstract":"It may be possible to approximate the full pion wave function in light-front QCD using only $q \\qbar$ and $q \\qbar g$ Fock space components. Removing zero modes and using invariant-mass cutoffs that make a constituent approximation possible leads to non-canonical terms in the QCD hamiltonian, and forces us to work in the broken symmetry phase of QCD in which chiral symmetry breaking operators must appear directly in the hamiltonian because the vacuum is trivial. Assuming any candidate interactions are local in the transverse direction, I argue that they are probably relevant operators so that perturbation theory is not modified at high energies. Since light-front chiral symmetry corresponds to quark helicity conservation, we can readily identify candidate chiral symmetry breaking interactions. The only candidate relevant operator is the quark-gluon emission/absorption operator with a quark spin flip. I argue that this operator can only produce the physical $\\pi-\\rho$ mass splitting if the $q \\qbar g$ component of the pion is significant.","created":"2000-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":6,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Heidelberg 2000/06/12"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: light front"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark antiquark: bound state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bound state: (quark antiquark gluon)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Hamiltonian formalism"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: emission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: absorption"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass difference: (rho(770) pi)"}],"num_refs":6,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Perry, Robert J."]}

We emphasize that the existence of the $\\sigma$ resonance does not contradict with the success of the chiral perturbation theory; phenomenological difficulties with the renormalizable linear sigma model do not necessarily deny the validity of the linear representation of ChS of QCD as given by the NJL-like models which not only admit the $\\sigma$ resonance but also reproduce the coupling constants $L_i$ and $H_i$ appearing the nonlinear chiral lagrangian. We give some examples of the hadronic phenomena which are naturally accounted for with the $\\sigma$ meson.

Photomeson interactions produce a burst of ~100 TeV neutrinos in coincidence with the GRB, and a burst of \\~10^18 eV neutrinos following the GRB on a time scale of 10 s. Inelastic p-n nuclear collisions result in the production of a burst of ~10 GeV neutrinos in coincidence with the GRB. Planned 1 km^3 neutrino telescopes are expected to detect tens of 100 TeV neutrino events, and several 10^18 eV events, correlated with GRBs per year. A suitably densely spaced detector may allow the detection of several 10 GeV events per year. The detection of high-energy neutrino events correlated with GRBs will allow to constrain GRB progenitor models and to test the suggestion that GRBs accelerate protons to >10^20 eV.

EDM searches yield constraints only under the assumption that parity symmetry is restored at the scale Lambda associated with new TVPC physics. If parity remains broken at short distances, direct searches yield the least ambiguous bounds.

We investigate the distributions of spike centers and, for Mg-Mg interactions, the energy spectra of negatively charged particles in spikes. The spike-center distributions are obtained to exhibit the structure expected from coherent gluon-jet emission dynamics. This structure is similar in both cases considered, namely for all charged and negatively charged particles, and is also similar to that observed recently for all-charged-particle spikes in hadronic interactions. The energy distribution within spikes is found to have a significant peak over the inclusive background, while the inclusive spectrum shows exponential decrease with two characteristic values of average kinetic energy. The value of the peak energy and its width are in a good agreement with those expected for pions produced in a nuclear medium in the framework of the Cerenkov quantum approach. The peak energy obtained is consistent with the value of the cross-section maximum observed in coincidence nucleon-nucleus interaction experiments.","created":"2000-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Torino 2000/06/12"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnesium"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"carbon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"copper"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus nucleus: coherent interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear reaction: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"4.3: 4.5 GeV/c/nucleon"}],"num_refs":31,"citation_count":9,"authors":["Gogiberidze, George L.","Sarkisian, Edward K.G.","Gelovani, Liana K."]}

As it was shown in the description of the asymmetry between the spectra of leading and nonleading charmed mesons measured in Sigma^--A interactions at p_L= 340 GeV/c in the WA89 experiment in previous studies, the asymmetries between D^- and D^+ meson spectra and between D_s^- and D^+_s meson spectra can be fitted by QGSM curves with the same parameter of string fragmentation, a_1=10, as well as the asymmetry between the D-meson spectra in pion-nuclear collisions in the E791 experiment. The forms of Lambda_c/antiLambda_c asymmetry dependences measured in Sigma^-A and p-A collisions at p_L= 600 GeV/c in the E781 experiment are different .

We first briefly review how, by a combination of analytic and numerical methods, the properties of the phase transition can be systematically resolved for any given type of a (weakly interacting) Higgs sector. We then summarise the numerical results available for the Standard Model, and present a generic model independent statement as to how the Higgs sector should differ from the Standard Model for the properties of the transition to be very different. As an explicit example, we discuss the possibilities available for a strong transition in the experimentally allowed parameter region of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.","created":"2000-10-25T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Marseille 2000/06/14"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimensional reduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background field"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":65,"citation_count":28,"authors":["Laine, M."]}

{"title":"Supersymmetric hybrid inflation","abstract":"The non-supersymmetric and supersymmetric versions of hybrid inflation are summarized. It is emphasized that supersymmetric hybrid inflation (with its extensions) is an extremely \"natural\" inflationary scenario since it does not require \"tiny\" parameters, its superpotential has the most general form allowed by the symmetries, and it can be protected against radiative or supergravity corrections. A concrete supersymmetric grand unified theory which leads to hybrid inflation, solves the mu problem and generates seesaw masses for the light neutrinos is constructed. The \"reheating\" which follows hybrid inflation is studied in this theory. It is shown that the gravitino constraint on the \"reheat\" temperature can be \"naturally\" satisfied. Also, the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated via a primordial leptogenesis consistently with the requirements from solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations. Extensions of the standard supersymmetric hybrid inflationary scenario which are still consistent with all these requirements but can also avoid the cosmological disaster from the possible copious monopole production at the abrupt termination of standard hybrid inflation are constructed. They rely on utilizing the leading non-renormalizable correction to the standard hybrid inflationary superpotential and are necessary for higher unified gauge groups which predict the existence of monopoles.","created":"2000-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Cascais 2000/06/26"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation: hybrid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: discrete"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction: CP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mu-problem"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":75,"citation_count":41,"authors":["Lazarides, George"]}

At very high energies, strong violation of KNO scaling behavior is observed (p-pbar) and expected to occur (e+e-). This challenges one to introduce novel, physically well motivated and preferably simple scaling rules obeyed by high-energy data.

This scaling principle is discussed here, illustrating its capabilities both on model predictions and on real data.","created":"2000-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Torino 2000/06/12"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: multiple production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"multiplicity: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling: KNO"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Mellin transformation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"intermittency"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fractal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":20,"authors":["Hegyi, Sandor"]}

{"title":"TESLA: Potentials of gamma gamma and e+ e- options in stoponium searches","abstract":"In some supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model fairly light superpartner of t-quark is predicted, which may form bound states - stoponiums. We estimate potentials of TESLA linear collider in search for stoponium, considering the basic e+e- option and the gamma-gamma option (Photon Linear Collider - PLC). It is found that PLC could be the best machine for discovery of these new narrow strong resonances. It can produce thousands stoponiums per 100 fb$^-1$ integrated luminosity in the high energy peak. In the case of scenarios when stoponium decays mainly into gluons the signal/background ratio is about 1/4. The channel S->hh into two lightest Higgs bosons could be also seen with high significance. Thus, several weeks run is sufficient for the stoponium discovery, if its mass is approximately known (e.g. from observation of direct stops production at LHC). Then, in MSSM scenarios with dominant S->hh decay PLC shows excellent possibilities to discover bound state of stops, practically immediately after beginning of operating. The e+e- option also has some prospects to observe stoponium but only in the case of scenarios with dominant decay into two lightest Higgs bosons, with tens of events per 100 $fb^{-1}$. Interesting possibility appears in the case when the resonance is seated on 0.1% width luminosity peak - one could resolve the stoponium exited states.","created":"2000-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Hamburg 2000/06/14"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: colliding beams"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"backscatter: laser"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon photon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: quarkonium"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"yield"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"500 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":30,"citation_count":15,"authors":["Gorbunov, D.S.","Ilyin, V.A.","Telnov, Valery I."]}

{"title":"Nonlinear effects in Compton scattering at photon colliders","abstract":"The backward Compton scattering is a basic process at future higher energy photon colliders. To obtain a high probability of e->gamma conversion the density of laser photons in the conversion region should be so high that simultaneous interaction of one electron with several laser photons is possible (nonlinear Compton effect). In this paper a detailed consideration of energy spectra, helicities of final photons and electrons in nonlinear backward Compton scattering of circularly polarized laser photons is given. Distributions of gamma-gamma luminosities with total helicities 0 and 2 are investigated. Very high intensity of laser wave leads to broadening of the energy (luminosity) spectra and shift to lower energies (invariant masses). Beside complicated exact formulae, approximate formulae for energy spectrum and polarization of backscattered photons are given for relatively small nonlinear parameter xi^2 (first order correction). All this is necessary for optimization of the conversion region at photon colliders and study of physics processes where a sharp edge of the luminosity spectrum and monochromaticity of collisions are important.","created":"2000-12-26T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":21,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Hamburg 2000/06/14"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: colliding beams"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"backscatter: laser"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Compton scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"helicity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"luminosity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":22,"authors":["Galynskii, Mikhail V.","Kuraev, Eduard","Levchuk, Michael","Telnov, Valery I."]}

The non-perturbative meson structure is described through the quark-model wave functions, constructed via the Hamiltonian light-front formalism using as input the Kalman-Tran-D'Souza equal time wave functions. A link between spectroscopic quark models and the H_Q decay physics is obtained in this way. It is shown that the bound-state effects and the Fermi motion of the b-quark remarkably reduce the decay rate with respect to the free-quark result.

{"title":"Physics impact of GigaZ","abstract":"By running the prospective high-energy e^+ e^- collider TESLA in the GigaZ mode on the Z resonance, experiments can be performed on the basis of more than 10^9 Z events. They will allow the measurement of the effective electroweak mixing angle to an accuracy of approximately +- 10^-5. Likewise the W boson mass is expected to be measurable with an error of about 6 MeV near the W^+ W^- threshold. In this note, we study the accuracy with which the Higgs boson mass can be determined from loop corrections to these observables in the Standard Model.

{"title":"Yukawa unified supersymmetric SO(10) model: Cosmology, rare decays and collider searches","abstract":"It has recently been pointed out that viable sparticle mass spectra can be generated in Yukawa unified SO(10) supersymmetric grand unified models consistent with radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry. Model solutions are obtained only if $\\tan\\beta \\sim 50$, $\\mu <0$ and positive $D$-term contributions to scalar masses from SO(10) gauge symmetry breaking are used. In this paper, we attempt to systematize the parameter space regions where solutions are obtained. We go on to calculate the relic density of neutralinos as a function of parameter space. No regions of the parameter space explored were actually cosmologically excluded, and very reasonable relic densities were found in much of parameter space. Direct neutralino detection rates could exceed 1 event/kg/day for a $^{73}$Ge detector, for low values of GUT scale gaugino mass $m_{1/2}$. We also calculate the branching fraction for $b\\to s \\gamma$ decays, and find that it is beyond the 95% CL experimental limits in much, but not all, of the parameter space regions explored. However, recent claims have been made that NLO effects can reverse the signs of certain amplitudes in the $b\\to s\\gamma$ calculation, leading to agreement between theory and experiment in Yukawa unified SUSY models. For the Fermilab Tevatron collider, significant regions of parameter space can be explored via $b\\bar{b}A$ and $b\\bar{b}H$ searches. There also exist some limited regions of parameter space where a trilepton signal can be seen at TeV33. Finally, there exist significant regions of parameter space where direct detection of bottom squark pair production can be made, especially for large negative values of the GUT parameter $A_0$.","created":"2000-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":35,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SO(10)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: multiple production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"final state: (3lepton)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"beauty --> strangeness photon"}],"num_refs":127,"citation_count":255,"authors":["Baer, Howard","Brhlik, Michal","Diaz, Marco A.","Ferrandis, Javier","Mercadante, Pedro","Quintana, Pamela","Tata, Xerxes"]}

Therefore, in this paper we analyze the stability of mixing angles against quantum corrections according to three types of neutrino mass hierarchies (Type A, B, C) and two Majorana phases. Two phases play the crucial roles for the stability of the mixing angles against the quantum corrections.","created":"2000-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: texture"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mixing angle: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":24,"citation_count":44,"authors":["Haba, Naoyuki","Matsui, Yoshimitsu","Okamura, Naotoshi"]}
{"title":"Signatures of massive sgoldstinos at hadron colliders","abstract":"In supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model with a very light gravitino, the effective theory at the weak scale should contain not only the goldstino, but also its supersymmetric partners, the sgoldstinos. In the simplest case, the goldstino is a gauge-singlet and its superpartners are two neutral spin-0 particles, S and P. We study possible signals of massive sgoldstinos at hadron colliders, focusing on those that are most relevant for the Tevatron. We show that inclusive production of sgoldstinos, followed by their decay into two photons, can lead to observable signals or to stringent combined bounds on the gravitino and sgoldstino masses. Sgoldstino decays into two gluon jets may provide a useful complementary signature.","created":"2000-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: Goldstino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon gluon: fusion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: associated production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: associated production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Batavia TEVATRON Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"1800: 2000 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":56,"citation_count":47,"authors":["Perazzi, Elena","Ridolfi, Giovanni","Zwirner, Fabio"]}

{"title":"Production and hadronization of heavy quarks","abstract":"Heavy long-lived quarks, i.e. charm and bottom, are frequently studied both as tests of QCD and as probes for other physics aspects within and beyond the standard model. The long life-time implies that charm and bottom hadrons are formed and observed. This hadronization process cannot be studied in isolation, but depends on the production environment. Within the framework of the string model, a major effect is the drag from the other end of the string that the c/b quark belongs to. In extreme cases, a small-mass string can collapse to a single hadron, thereby giving a non-universal flavour composition to the produced hadrons. We here develop and present a detailed model for the charm/bottom hadronization process, involving the various aspects of string fragmentation and collapse, and put it in the context of several heavy-flavour production sources. Applications are presented from fixed-target to LHC energies.","created":"2000-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":40,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: hadronization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charm"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model: fragmentation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rapidity spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation: (quark antiquark)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: cluster"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi- p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p nucleus: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charmed particle: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":81,"citation_count":245,"authors":["Norrbin, E.","Sjostrand, T."]}
{"title":"Generations of Higgs bosons in supersymmetric models","abstract":"We examine extensions of the MSSM with more than one generation of Higgs bosons. If one assumes that a symmetry eliminates the tree-level FCNC, then the extra scalar bosons do not acquire VEVs, do not couple to fermions and do not mix with the ordinary Higgs bosons; the lightest is absolutely stable. The two lightest neutral scalars, $\\phi_S$, and $\\phi_P$, are degenerate in mass, and the mass difference between those and the lightest charged scalar, $\\phi_+$, is calculated. For most of the parameter space, the charged scalar is between a hundred MeV and a few GeV heavier than the neutral scalars. The $\\phi_+$ will decay at the vertex; the signature for this decay will be like that of a chargino with a nearly degenerate undetected neutralino. Next, the possibility that the symmetry that eliminates FCNC is a flavor symmetry is discussed. In an example, the U(2) model, tree-level FCNC processes can be calculated in terms of quark masses. The strongest constraint on this model is from $D-\\bar{D}$ mixing, which should be within an order of magnitude of the current bound.","created":"2000-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":11,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: doublet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: neutral particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: charged particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: U(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tree approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D0 anti-D0: mixing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":12,"citation_count":17,"authors":["Aranda, Alfredo","Sher, Marc"]}

Sizable symmetry breaking in the wave-functions is required to reproduce the observed spacing in the spectrum of the (1/2)^+ baryons. The matrix elements of the flavor symmetric charge operators nevertheless yield g_A/g_V ratios for hyperon beta-decay which agree with the empirical data approximately as well as the successful F&D parameterization of the Cabibbo scheme. Demanding the strangeness component in the nucleon to vanish in the two flavor limit of the model, determines the structure of the singlet axial charge operator and yields the various quark flavor components of the axial charge of the \\Lambda-hyperon.

The Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken at a scale which is the geometric mean between the weak scale and the Planck scale, yielding a mu term of the right order of magnitude and an invisible axion. These models also predict one or more singlet fermions which have electroweak-scale masses and suppressed couplings to MSSM states. I consider the case that such a singlet fermion, containing the axino as an admixture, is the lightest supersymmetric particle. I work out the relevant couplings in several of the simplest models of this type, and compute the partial decay widths of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle involving leptons or jets. Although these decays will have an average proper decay length which is most likely much larger than a typical collider detector, they can occasionally occur within the detector, providing a striking signal. With a large sample of supersymmetric events, there will be an opportunity to observe these decays, and so gain direct information about physics at very high energy scales.","created":"2000-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: singlet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"LSP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"slepton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":54,"citation_count":48,"authors":["Martin, Stephen P."]}

The main motivation for investigating these processes is the determination of the polarized gluon density at the COMPASS and RHIC experiments, respectively, in the near future. All methods used in the computation are extensively documented, providing a self-contained introduction to this type of calculations. Some employed tools also may be of general interest, e.g., the series expansion of hypergeometric functions. The relevant parton level results are collected and plotted in the form of scaling functions. However, the simplification of the obtained gluon-gluon virtual contributions has not been completed yet. Thus NLO phenomenological predictions are only given in the case of photoproduction. The theoretical uncertainties of these predictions, in particular with respect to the heavy quark mass, are carefully considered. Also it is shown that transverse momentum cuts can considerably enhance the measured production asymmetries. Finally unpolarized heavy quark production is reviewed in order to derive conditions for a successful interpretation of future spin-dependent experimental data.","created":"2000-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":187,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"heavy quark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"regularization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"kinematics: phase space"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"factorization: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":143,"citation_count":22,"authors":["Bojak, Ingo"]}

It describes the dependence of the free energy on an infrared cutoff for the quantum or thermal fluctuations. Non-perturbative solutions follow from approximations to the general form of the coarse-grained free energy or effective average action. They interpolate between the microphysical laws and the complex macroscopic phenomena. Our approach yields a simple unified description for O(N)-symmetric scalar models in two, three or four dimensions, covering in particular the critical phenomena for the second-order phase transitions, including the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and the critical behavior of polymer chains. We compute the aspects of the critical equation of state which are universal for a large variety of physical systems and establish a direct connection between microphysical and critical quantities for a liquid-gas transition. Universal features of first-order phase transitions are studied in the context of scalar matrix models. We show that the quantitative treatment of coarse graining is essential for a detailed estimate of the nucleation rate. We discuss quantum statistics in thermal equilibrium or thermal quantum field theory with fermions and bosons and we describe the high temperature symmetry restoration in quantum field theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

The maximum temperature in the radiation-dominated era, which we will refer to as the reheat temperature, may have been as low as 0.7 MeV. In this paper we show that a low reheat temperature has important implications for many topics in cosmology. We show that weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) may be produced even if the reheat temperature is much smaller than the freeze-out temperature of the WIMP, and that the dependence of the present abundance on the mass and the annihilation cross section of the WIMP differs drastically from familiar results. We revisit predictions of the relic abundance and resulting model constraints of supersymmetric dark matter, axions, massive neutrinos, and other dark matter candidates, nucleosynthesis constraints on decaying particles, and leptogenesis by decay of superheavy particles. We find that the allowed parameter space of supersymmetric models is altered, removing the usual bounds on the mass spectrum; the cosmological bound on massive neutrinos is drastically changed, ruling out Dirac (Majorana) neutrino masses $m_\\nu$ only in the range 33 keV $\\simlt m_\\nu\\simlt$ 6 (5) MeV, which is significantly smaller from the the standard disallowed range 94 eV $\\simlt m_\\nu\\simlt$ 2 GeV (this implies that massive neutrinos may still play the role of either warm or cold dark matter); the cosmological upper bound on the Peccei-Quinn scale may be significantly increased to $ 10^{16}$GeV from the usually cited limit of about $10^{12}$GeV; and that efficient out-of-equilibrium GUT baryogenesis and/or leptogenesis can take place even if the reheat temperature is much smaller than the mass of the decaying superheavy particle.","created":"2000-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":27,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"WIMP: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"axion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: massive"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"particle: heavy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"particle: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":66,"citation_count":520,"authors":["Giudice, Gian Francesco","Kolb, Edward W.","Riotto, Antonio"]}

{"title":"Gluon radiation off hard quarks in a nuclear environment: Opacity expansion","abstract":"We study the relation between the Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigne-Schiff (BDMPS) and Zakharov formalisms for medium-induced gluon radiation off hard quarks, and the radiation off very few scattering centers. Based on the non-abelian Furry approximation for the motion of hard partons in a spatially extended colour field, we derive a compact diagrammatic and explicitly colour trivial expression for the N-th order term of the kt-differential gluon radiation cross section in an expansion in the opacity of the medium. Resumming this quantity to all orders in opacity, we obtain Zakharov's path-integral expression (supplemented with a regularization prescription). This provides a new proof of the equivalence of the BDMPS and Zakharov formalisms which extends previous arguments to the kt-differential cross section. We give explicit analytical results up to third order in opacity for both the gluon radiation cross section of free incoming and of in-medium produced quarks. The N-th order term in the opacity expansion of the radiation cross section is found to be a convolution of the radiation associated to N-fold rescattering and a readjustment of the probabilities that rescattering occurs with less than N scattering centers. Both informations can be disentangled by factorizing out of the radiation cross section a term which depends only on the mean free path of the projectile. This allows to infer analytical expressions for the totally coherent and totally incoherent limits of the radiation cross section to arbitrary orders in opacity.","created":"2000-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"multiple scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: triviality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"path integral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"}],"num_refs":24,"citation_count":589,"authors":["Wiedemann, Urs Achim"]}

Furthermore, if the gravitino mass is larger than about 100 MeV, the decay of the next-to-LSP (NLSP) into the gravitino may modify disastrously the abundances of the light elements predicted by the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN).

The new flavour physics contribution to $K-\\bar K,$ $B-\\bar B$ mixing is small but might be of phenomenological interest in the case of $b\\to s\\gamma.$ The sign of the latter contribution is the same as the sign of the dominant chargino contribution, thus making the constraints on SUSY scale coming from $b\\to s\\gamma$ somewhat more restrictive.

{"title":"SNO and the neutrino magnetic moment solution of the solar neutrino problem","abstract":"Assuming that the solar neutrino deficit observed in the Homestake, SAGE, Gallex, Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments is due to the interaction of the neutrino transition magnetic moment with the solar magnetic field, we calculate the expected values of a number of observables to be measured by SNO. For three model solar magnetic field profiles that produce the best fits of the previous data we calculate the charged current event rate, the (neutral current)/(charged current) event ratio and the charged current electron spectrum as well as its first and second moments. We study the dependence of the calculated observables on the choice of the magnetic field profile and on the value of the solar $hep$ neutrino flux. We also compare our results with those obtained assuming that the solar neutrino problem is due to neutrino oscillations in vacuum or in matter. We show that there is an overlap or partial overlap between our predictions and those found for each of the oscillation solutions (SMA, LMA, LOW and VO). Given the uncertainties in the calculations and the expected uncertainties in the experimental results, the unambiguous discrimination between the two types of solutions to the solar neutrino problem (neutrino oscillations and magnetic moments) on the basis of the average rates and electron spectrum distortions appears to be difficult. The possible time dependence of the charged current signal and spectrum distortion in the case of the magnetic moment solution therefore remains the best hope for such a discrimination. For a hybrid solution (neutrino magnetic moment plus flavour mixing) the smoking gun signature would be an observation of $\\bar{\\nu}_e$'s from the sun.","created":"2000-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: magnetic moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnetic field: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charged current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flux"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":38,"citation_count":49,"authors":["Akhmedov, Evgeny K.","Pulido, Joao"]}

We use minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) unification assumptions for the SUSY breaking parameters. The discovery reach at high m_0 is of renewed interest because this region has recently been found to have a focus point, leading to relatively low fine-tuning, and because it remains uncertain how much of the region can be ruled out due to lack of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. The best fine tuning reach is found in a mono-leptonic channel, where for mu>0, A_0=0 and tan beta=10 (within the focus point region), and a top mass of 174 GeV, all points in mSUGRA with m_0 < 4000 GeV, with a fine tuning measure up to 210 (500) are covered by the search, where the definition of fine-tuning excludes (includes) the contribution from the top Yukawa coupling. Even for arbitrarily high m_0, mSUGRA can be discovered through gaugino events, provided the gaugino mass parameter M_1/2 < 460 GeV.

The analysis utilised the normalised cumulants calculated in three-dimensional phase space of the reaction ee -> Z -> hadrons using a large Monte Carlo sample. The multi-sources events were simulated by overlaying a few independent single ee annihilation events. It was found that as the number of sources increases, the cumulants do not change significantly their structure, but those of an order higher than two decrease fast in their magnitude. This reduction and its amount can be understood in terms of combinatorial considerations of source mixing which dilutes the correlations. The diminishing of the genuine correlations is consistent with recent cumulant measurements in hadron and nucleus induced reactions and should also be relevant to other dynamical correlations like the Bose-Einstein one, in ee -> WW -> hadrons and in nucleus-nucleus reactions.","created":"2000-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.85.Hd"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"25.75.Gz"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"02.70.Lq"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"07.05.Tp"},{"source":"author","value":"Multihadron production"},{"source":"author","value":"Genuine correlations"},{"source":"author","value":"Monte Carlo simulations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: multiple production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cumulant expansion: rapidity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation: ((n)particle)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus nucleus: nuclear reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"}],"num_refs":30,"citation_count":23,"authors":["Alexander, Gideon","Sarkisian, Edward"]}

{"title":"Analytic coupling and Sudakov effects in exclusive processes: Pion and gamma* gamma ---> pi0 form-factors","abstract":"We develop and discuss in technical detail an infrared-finite factorization and optimized renormalization scheme for calculating exclusive processes, which enables the inclusion of transverse degrees of freedom without entailing suppression of calculated observables, like form factors. This is achieved by employing an analytic, i.e., infrared stable, running strong coupling $\\alpha _{\\rm s}(Q^{2})$ which removes the Landau singularity at $Q^{2}=\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}^{2}$ by a minimum power-behaved correction. The ensuing contributions to the cusp anomalous dimension - related to the Sudakov form factor - and to the quark anomalous dimension - which controls evolution - lead to an enhancement at high $Q^{2}$ of the hard part of exclusive amplitudes, calculated in perturbative QCD, while simultaneously improving its scaling behavior. The phenomenological implications of this framework are analyzed by applying it to the pion's electromagnetic form factor, including the NLO contribution to the hard-scattering amplitude, and also to the pion-photon transition at LO. For the pion wave function, an improved ansatz of the Brodsky-Huang-Lepage type is employed, which includes an effective (constituent-like) quark mass, $m_{\\rm q}=0.33$ GeV. Predictions for both form factors are presented and compared to the experimental data, applying Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie commensurate scale setting. We find that the perturbative hart part prevails at momentum transfers above about 20 GeV ${}^{2}$, while at lower $Q^{2}$-values the pion form factor is dominated by Feynman-type contributions. The theoretical prediction for the $\\gamma ^{*}\\gamma \\to \\pi ^{0}$ form factor indicates that the true pion distribution amplitude may be somewhat broader than the asymptotic one.","created":"2000-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":34,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor: transition"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi0"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"infrared problem: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor: Sudakov"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"factorization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":115,"citation_count":131,"authors":["Stefanis, N.G.","Schroers, W.","Kim, Hyun-Chul"]}

For the inclusive structure function, comparison with recent HERA data and the existing FFN calculation reveals that the relatively simple order-$\\alpha_s$ (NLO) 4-flavor ($m_c \\neq 0$) calculation can, in practice, be extended to rather low energy scales, yielding good agreement with data over the full measured $Q^2$ range. The Monte Carlo implementation also allows the calculation of differential distributions with relevant kinematic cuts. Comparisons with available HERA data show qualitative agreement; however, they also indicate the need to extend the calculation to the next order to obtain better description of the differential distributions.","created":"2000-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":23,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charmed meson: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D*(2010)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: charm"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: DESY HERA Stor"}],"num_refs":41,"citation_count":39,"authors":["Amundson, James","Schmidt, Carl","Tung, Wu-Ki","Wang, Xiaoning"]}

{"title":"Real time nonequilibrium dynamics in hot QED plasmas: Dynamical renormalization group approach","abstract":"We study the real-time nonequilibrium dynamics in hot QED plasmas implementing a dynamical renormalization group and using the hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation. The focus is on the study of the relaxation of gauge and fermionic mean fields and on the quantum kinetics of the photon and fermion distribution functions. For semihard photons of momentum eT << k << T we find to leading order in the HTL that the gauge mean field relaxes in time with a power law as a result of infrared enhancement of the spectral density near the Landau damping threshold. The dynamical renormalization group reveals the emergence of detailed balance for microscopic time scales larger than 1/k while the rates are still varying with time. The quantum kinetic equation for the photon distribution function allows us to study photon production from a thermalized quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by off-shell effects. We find that for a QGP at temperature T ~ 200 MeV and of lifetime 10 < t < 50 fm/c the hard (k ~ T) photon production from off-shell bremsstrahlung (q -> q \\gamma and \\bar{q} -> \\bar{q}\\gamma) at O(\\alpha) grows logarithmically in time and is comparable to that produced from on-shell Compton scattering and pair annihilation at O(\\alpha \\alpha_s).

{"title":"Nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of second order phase transitions","abstract":"We use the so-called Liouville-von Neumann (LvN) approach to study the nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of time-dependent second order phase transitions. The LvN approach is a canonical method that unifies the functional Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for the quantum evolution of pure states and the LvN equation for the quantum description of mixed states of either equilibrium or nonequilibrium. As nonequilibrium quantum mechanical systems we study a time-dependent harmonic and an anharmonic oscillator and find the exact Fock space and density operator for the harmonic oscillator and the nonperturbative Gaussian Fock space and density operator for the anharmonic oscillator. The density matrix and the coherent, thermal and coherent-thermal states are found in terms of their classical solutions, for which the effective Hamiltonians and equations of motion are derived. The LvN approach is further extended to quantum fields undergoing time-dependent second order phase transitions. We study an exactly solvable model with a finite smooth quench and find the two-point correlation functions.

{"title":"QCD at finite isospin density","abstract":"QCD at finite isospin chemical potential mu_I has no fermion sign problem and can be studied on the lattice. We solve this theory analytically in two limits: at low mu_I where chiral perturbation theory is applicable, and at asymptotically high mu_I where perturbative QCD works. At low isospin density the ground state is a pion condensate, whereas at high density it is a Fermi liquid with Cooper pairing. The pairs carry the same quantum numbers as the pion. This leads us to a conjecture that the transition from hadron to quark matter is smooth, which passes several tests. Our results imply a nontrivial phase diagram in the space of temperature and chemical potentials of isospin and baryon number.","created":"2000-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"isospin: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: chemical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transition: quark hadron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: liquid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N: color"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"confinement"}],"num_refs":37,"citation_count":552,"authors":["Son, D.T.","Stephanov, Misha A."]}

In particular, inflation could do this if the expansion rate is sufficiently large. We present a simplified version of the Goldberger-Wise mechanism in which the radion potential can be computed exactly, and we calculate the rate of thermal transitions to the true minimum, showing that model parameters can be chosen to ensure that the universe reaches the desired final state.

{"title":"Discovering mirror particles at the large hadron collider and the implied cold universe","abstract":"The Mirror Matter or Exact Parity Model sees every standard particle, including the physical neutral Higgs boson, paired with a parity partner. The unbroken parity symmetry forces the mass eigenstate Higgs bosons to be maximal mixtures of the ordinary and mirror Higgs bosons. Each of these mass eigenstates will therefore decay 50% of the time into invisible mirror particles, providing a clear and interesting signature for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which could thus establish the existence of the mirror world. However, for this effect to be observable the mass difference between the two eigenstates must be sufficiently large. In this paper, we study cosmological constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the mass difference parameter. We find that the temperature of the radiation dominated (RD) phase of the universe should never have exceeded a few 10's of GeV if the mass difference is to be observable at the LHC. Chaotic inflation with very inefficient reheating provides an example of how such a cosmology could arise. We conclude that the LHC could thus discover the mirror world and simultaneously establish an upper bound on the temperature of the RD phase of the universe.","created":"2000-05-25T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"search for: mirror particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mirror particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics: constraint"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light nucleus: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"proposed experiment: CERN LHC Coll"}],"num_refs":35,"citation_count":50,"authors":["Ignatiev, A.Yu.","Volkas, R.R."]}

{"title":"Discrete flavor symmetries and mass matrix textures","abstract":"We show how introducing discrete Abelian flavor symmetries can produce texture zeros in the fermion mass matrices, while preserving the correct relationships with the low-energy data on quark and lepton masses. We outline a procedure for defining texture zeros as suppressed entries in Yukawa matrices. These texture zeros can account for the coexistence of the observed large mixing in atmospheric neutrino oscillations with a hierarchy in the neutrino masses, and offer the possibility of alignment of the quark and squark mass matrices, and thus giving a solution to the supersymmetric flavor problem. A requirement that the flavor symmetry commutes with the SU(5) grand unified group can be used to explain the lepton mass hierarchies as well as the neutrino parameters, including the large mixing observed in the atmospheric neutrino data. We present one such model that yields a large atmospheric neutrino mixing angle, as well as a solar neutrino mixing angle of order $\\lambda \\simeq 0.22$.","created":"2000-05-25T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: discrete"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: U(1) x Z(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"texture: 0"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SU(5)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CKM matrix matrix"}],"num_refs":44,"citation_count":33,"authors":["Berger, M.S.","Siyeon, Kim"]}

By substantially eliminating the arbitrariness associated to the magnetic field profile due to both mathematical consistency and physical requirements we propose the simplest scheme (MHD-RSF, for short) for solar neutrino conversion using realistic static MHD solutions. Using such effective two-parameter scheme we perform the first global fit of the recent solar neutrino data, including event rates as well as zenith angle distributions and recoil electron spectra induced by solar neutrino interactions in Superkamiokande. We compare quantitatively our simplest MHD-RSF fit with vacuum oscillation (VAC) and MSW-type (SMA, LMA and LOW) solutions to the solar neutrino problem using a common well-calibrated theoretical calculation and fit procedure. We find our MHD-RSF fit to be somewhat better than those obtained for the favored neutrino oscillation solutions, though not in a statistically significant way.

In this range, which interpolates smoothly between the so-called ``just-so'' and ``Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein'' oscillation regimes, neutrino flavor transitions are increasingly affected by matter effects as \\delta m^2/E increases. As a consequence, the usual vacuum approximation has to be improved through the matter-induced corrections, leading to a ``quasi-vacuum'' oscillation regime. We perform accurate numerical calculations of such corrections, using both the true solar density profile and its exponential approximation. Matter effects are shown to be somewhat overestimated in the latter case. We also discuss the role of Earth crossing and of energy smearing.

{"title":"Signatures of heavy Majorana neutrinos and HERA's isolated lepton events","abstract":"The graph of neutrinoless double beta decay is applied to HERA and generalized to final states with any two charged leptons. Considered is the case in which one of the two escapes typical identification criteria and the case when a produced tau decays hadronically. Both possibilities give one isolated lepton with high transverse momentum, hadronic activity and an imbalance in transverse momentum. We examine the kinematical properties of these events and compare them with the high p_T isolated leptons reported by the H1 collaboration. Their positive charged muon events can be explained by the ``double beta'' process and we discuss possibilities for the precise determination which original final state produced the single isolated lepton. To confirm our hypothesis one should search in the data for high pseudorapidity and/or low p_T leptons or for additional separated jets.","created":"2000-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron nucleon: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron nucleon: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: associated production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: high"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"kinematics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: massive"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: DESY HERA Stor"}],"num_refs":43,"citation_count":21,"authors":["Rodejohann, W.","Zuber, K."]}

The origin of domain walls with appropriate size and energy density could be a result of evolution of an effectively massless scalar field at the inflational epoch. We demonstrate that in this case the situation is valued when there are compact domains of less favorable vacuum surrounded by a sea of another vacuum. Each domain has a surface composed of vacuum wall that stores a significant amount of energy, and can collapse into the black hole. This offers the way of massive primordial black holes formation in the early Universe.","created":"2000-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"black hole: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"domain wall"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"black hole: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":37,"citation_count":81,"authors":["Rubin, S.G.","Khlopov, M.Yu.","Sakharov, A.S."]}
{"title":"Quantum field theory at finite temperature: An Introduction","abstract":"In these notes we review some properties of Statistical Quantum Field Theory at equilibrium, i.e Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature. We explain the relation between finite temperature quantum field theory in (d,1) dimensions and statistical classical field theory in d+1 dimensions. This identification allows to analyze the finite temperature QFT in terms of the renormalization group and the theory of finite size effects of the classical theory. We discuss in particular the limit of high temperature (HT) or the situation of finite temperature phase transitions. There the concept of dimensional reduction plays an essential role. Dimensional reduction in some sense reflects the known property that quantum effects are not important at high temperature. We illustrate these ideas with several standard examples, phi^4 field theory, the non-linear sigma model and the Gross-Neveu model, gauge theories. We construct the corresponding effective reduced theories at one-loop order, using the technique of mode expansion of fields in the imaginary time variable. In models where the field is a vector with N components, the large N expansion provides another specially convenient tool to study dimensional reduction.","created":"2000-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":65,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"review"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: statistical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"any-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: finite size"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimensional reduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"phi**n model: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sigma model: nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Gross-Neveu model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs model: abelian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":66,"citation_count":37,"authors":["Zinn-Justin, Jean"]}

{"title":"Sneutrino-Higgs mixing in W W and Z Z production in supersymmetry with R-parity violation","abstract":"We consider new s-channel scalar exchanges in e+e- -> ZZ,W+W- in supersymmetry with a small lepton number violation. We show that a small bilinear R-parity violating term which leads to sneutrino--Higgs mixing can give rise to a significant scalar resonance enhancement in e+e- -> ZZ,W+W-. We use the LEP2 measurements of the WW and ZZ cross-sections to place useful constraints on this scenario. We also find, under conservative assumptions on the relevant parameter space involved, that such an exchange of the sneutrino-like admixture in e+e- -> ZZ,W+W- may be accessible to a 500 GeV e+e- collider.","created":"2000-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.60.Jv"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.30.Fs"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.80.Cp"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.85.Lg"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"intermediate boson: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sneutrino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: CERN LEP Stor"}],"num_refs":18,"citation_count":8,"authors":["Bar-Shalom, S.","Eilam, G.","Mele, B."]}
{"title":"Roy equation analysis of pi pi scattering","abstract":"We analyze the Roy equations for the lowest partial waves of elastic pi pi scattering and demonstrate that the two S-wave scattering lengths a_0^0 and a_0^2 are the essential parameters in the low energy region: Once these are known, the available experimental information determines the behaviour near threshold to within remarkably small uncertainties. An explicit numerical representation for the energy dependence of the S- and P-waves is given and it is shown that the threshold parameters of the D- and F-waves are also fixed very sharply in terms of a_0^0 and a^2_0. In agreement with earlier work, which is reviewed in some detail, we find that the Roy equations admit physically acceptable solutions only within a band of the (a_0^0,a_0^2) plane. We show that the data on the reactions e+e- -> pi pi and tau -> pi pi nu reduce the width of this band quite significantly. Furthermore, we discuss the relevance of the decay K -> pi pi e nu in restricting the allowed range of a_0^0, preparing the grounds for an analysis of the forthcoming precision data on this decay and on pionic atoms. We expect these to reduce the uncertainties in the two basic low energy parameters very substantially, so that a meaningful test of the chiral perturbation theory predictions will become possible.","created":"2000-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":85,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi pi: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partial wave analysis: Roy equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"isospin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"integral equations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi pi: scattering length"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"threshold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dispersion relation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sum rule"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":98,"citation_count":461,"authors":["Ananthanarayan, B.","Colangelo, G.","Gasser, J.","Leutwyler, H."]}

{"title":"The mass of the eta-prime meson in the chiral limit due to instantons","abstract":"Using the trace anomaly and low energy relations, as well as Witten-Veneziano formula for the mass of the $\\eta'$ meson, the chiral topology of the QCD nonperturbative instanton vacuum has been numerically evaluated. Our formalism makes it possible to express the topological susceptibility and the mass of the $\\eta'$ meson as a functions of the instanton number density in the chiral limit. We have explicitly shown that the topological susceptibility in this case is approximately one fours and one half of its phenomenological value at instanton number densities in the chiral limit, 0.5 fm^{-4} and 1.0 fm^{-4}, respectively. Thus the instanton contributions substantially underestimate the mass of the $\\eta'$ meson which still remains large in the chiral limit. With the help of the above-mentioned Witten-Veneziano formula, we derived an absolute lower bounds for the pion decay constant and the mass of the $\\eta'$ meson in the chiral limit.","created":"2000-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.15.Tk"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Lg"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"eta(958): mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"susceptibility: topological"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state: instanton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"low-energy theorem"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anomaly"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"U(1) problem"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":51,"citation_count":7,"authors":["Gogohia, V."]}
{"title":"The b ---> s gamma decay in SUSY models with nonuniversal A terms","abstract":"We analyse the predictions for the inclusive branching ratio for $b\\to s\\gamma$ decay in a class of string-inspired SUSY models with non-universal soft-breaking A-terms. These models are particularly interesting since the non-universality of the A-terms plays an important role in providing new significant contributions to CP violation effects in kaon physics while respecting the severe bounds on electric dipole moments. We show that $b\\to s\\gamma$ do not severely constrain the non-universality of these models. In particular, at low $\\tan\\beta$ $(\\tan\\beta\\simeq 2)$, our predictions are close to the universal case. For large $\\tan\\beta$ ($\\tan\\beta \\gsim 15$),the effect of non-universality is enhanced and stronger constraints hold.

We find that future lepton colliders with high energy and high luminosity have great potential to sensitively probe these physics scenarios. In particular, at a 1.5 TeV linear collider with an integrated luminosity of 200 fb$^{-1}$, we expect about 120 events for either a scalar or a vector to decay to $t\\bar t, t \\bar b$.
