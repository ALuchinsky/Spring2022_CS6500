{"title":"Nucleons as chiral solitons","abstract":"In the limit of large number of colors N the nucleon consisting of N quarks is heavy, and one can treat it semiclassically, like the large-Z Thomas--Fermi atom. The role of the semiclassical field binding the quarks in the nucleon is played by the pion or chiral field; its saddle-point distribution inside the nucleon is called the chiral soliton. The old Skyrme model for this soliton is an over-simplification. One can do far better by exploiting a realistic and theoretically-motivated effective chiral lagrangian presented in this paper. As a result one gets not only the static characteristics of the nucleon in a fair accordance with the experiment (such as masses, magnetic moments and formfactors) but also much more detailed dynamic characteristics like numerous parton distributions. We review the foundations of the Chiral Quark-Soliton Model of the nucleon as well as its recent applications to parton distributions, including the recently introduced `skewed' distributions, and to the nucleon wave function on the light cone.","created":"2000-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":58,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"soliton: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Skyrme model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Wess-Zumino term"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: confinement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon number"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light cone: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N: color"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":102,"citation_count":85,"authors":["Diakonov, Dmitri","Petrov, Victor Yu."]}
{"title":"Soft QCD dynamics of elastic scattering in impact parameter representation","abstract":"The elastic hadronic amplitude is calculated using the nonperturbative light-cone dipole representation for gluon bremsstrahlung. The data for large mass diffraction demand a two-scale structure of light hadrons: the gluon clouds of the valence quarks with a size of 0.3fm and the hadronic size 1fm. The presence of the two scales unavoidably leads to a specific form for the total hadronic cross section which consists of a steeply rising \\propto s^{\\Delta} (\\Delta=0.17 +/- 0.01) term related to gluon radiation, and a large constant term originating from soft interactions which does not induce any gluon emission. Our calculations reproduce well the total cross sections and elastic slopes \\cite{k3p}. To further test the model, we analyze the elastic pp and ppbar differential cross sections and extract the partial amplitudes in the impact parameter representation. The Pomeron trajectory as a function of the impact parameter is only slightly above one for central collisions, but steeply grows towards the periphery. The model predicts correctly the shape and energy dependence of the partial amplitude at all impact parameters.","created":"2000-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":33,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"small-angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"impact parameter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: bremsstrahlung"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"total cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pomeron: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section: momentum transfer"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":72,"citation_count":61,"authors":["Kopeliovich, B.Z.","Potashnikova, I.K.","Povh, B.","Predazzi, E."]}

For hard dijets the Pomeron splitting mechanism in which both helicity amplitudes are proportional to the unintegrated gluon structure function of the proton and the pion distribution amplitude is shown to dominate. In nuclear diffraction multiple Pomeron splitting components are found to give antishadowing contributions at large jet momentum. To leading twist there is an exact cancelation of effects of nuclear attenuation and antishadowing/broadening of multiple Pomeron splitting contributions. The next-to-leading higher twist correction driven by nuclear rescatterings is calculable in hard QCD and proves to be numerically very large. We argue that large higher twist effects do not preclude the determination of gross features of the pion distribution amplitude.

{"title":"Supersymmetric microscopic theory of the standard model","abstract":"We promote the microscopic theory of standard model (MSM, hep-ph/0007077) into supersymmetric framework in order to solve its technical aspects of vacuum zero point energy and hierarchy problems, and attempt, further, to develop its realistic viable minimal SUSY extension. Among other things that - the MSM provides a natural unification of geometry and the field theory, has clarified the physical conditions in which the geometry and particles come into being, in microscopic sense enables an insight to key problems of particle phenomenology and answers to some of its nagging questions - a present approach also leads to quite a new realization of the SUSY yielding a physically realistic particle spectrum. It stems from the special subquark algebra, from which the nilpotent supercharge operators are derived. The resulting theory makes plausible following testable implications for the current experiments at LEP2, at the Tevatron and at LHC drastically different from those of the conventional MSSM models: 1. All the sparticles and Higgs bosons never could emerge in spacetime continuum, thus, they cannot be discovered in these experiments nor at any energy range. 2.

In the case of SUSY QCD the simulation takes into account not only gluons and quarks as cascading particles, but also their supersymmetric partners. A new model-independent hadronization scheme is developed, in which the hadronization functions are found from LEP data. An interesting feature of SUSY QCD is the prediction of a sizeable flux of the lightest supersymmetric particles (LSPs), if R-parity is conserved. About 10% of the jet energy is transferred to LSPs which, owing to their harder spectra, constitute an important part of the spectra for large $x=E/E_{jet}$. Spectra of protons and of secondary particles, photons and neutrinos, are also calculated. These results have implications for the decay of superheavy particles with masses up to the GUT scale, which have been suggested as a source of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.","created":"2000-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":25,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: fragmentation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: hadronization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: flux"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"LSP: flux"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: cascade"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: hadronization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: hadronization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"}],"num_refs":41,"citation_count":98,"authors":["Berezinsky, V.","Kachelriess, M."]}

Since from all S-matrix elements $<i|S|PP>$ involving $PP$ only some ($i = M_1 M_2$) contribute to the final state rescatterring, the latter is treated as a correction only. The rescatterring of resonance pair $M_1 M_2$ into the final $PP$ state is assumed to proceed through Regge exchange. Although effects due to a single intermediate state $M_1 M_2$ are small, it is shown that the combined effect of all such states should be large.

On the other hand the sterile neutrino scalar partner can trigger the spontaneous violation of R-parity, thereby inducing the necessary mass splittings to fit also the solar and atmospheric neutrino data. Thus the model can explain all neutrino oscillation data. It leads to four predictions for the neutrino oscillation parameters and implies that the atmospheric neutrino problem must include at least some $\\nu_{\\mu} \\to \\nu_s$ oscillations, which will be testable in the near future.

The similarity renormalization group is based on similarity transformations that regulate off-diagonal matrix elements, forcing the hamiltonian towards a band-diagonal form as the cutoff is lowered. This avoids pathologies that plagued tradition transformations acting on hamiltonians, making it possible to produce a well-behaved perturbative approximation of renormalized hamiltonians in asymptotically free theories.

This fact might have important implications on the determination of WIMP relic densities. On the other hand, the definition of number densities in a interacting theory is not a straightforward procedure. It usually requires renormalization of composite operators and operator mixing, which obscure the physical interpretation of the computed thermal average. We propose a new definition for the thermal average of a composite operator, which does not require any new renormalization counterterm and is thus free from such ambiguities. Applying this definition to the model of Matsumoto and Yoshimura we find that it gives number densities which are Boltzmann-suppressed at any order in perturbation theory.

{"title":"Pion decay widths of D mesons","abstract":"The pionic decay rates of the excited $L=0,1$ $D$ mesons are calculated with a Hamiltonian model within the framework of the covariant Blankenbecler-Sugar {equation.} The interaction between the light quark and charm antiquark is described by a linear scalar confining and a screened one-gluon exchange interaction. The decay widths of the $D^*$ mesons obtain a contribution from the exchange current that is associated with the linear scalar confining interaction. If this contribution is taken into account along with the single quark approximation, the calculated decay rates of the charged $D^*$ mesons are readily below the current empirical upper limits if the axial coupling constant of the light constituent quarks is taken to be $g_A^q$ = 0.87, but reach the empirical upper limits if $g_A^q$ = 1. With the conventional values for $g_A^q$, the calculated widths of the $D_1$ and $D_2^*$ mesons fall somewhat below the experimental lower limits, leaving room for other decay modes as well, such as $\\pi\\pi$ decay. The unrealistically large contribution from the axial charge operator to the calculated pion decay width of the $D_1$ meson is suppressed by taking into account the exchange charge effects that are associated with the scalar linear confining and vector one-gluon exchange interactions. The predicted values for the pionic widths of the hitherto undiscovered L=1 $D_1^*$ and $D_0^*$ mesons are found to be smaller than previous estimates.","created":"2000-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.39.Ki"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.25.Ft"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.40.Ib"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D*(2010): hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D1(2420): hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D*2(2460): hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Hamiltonian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charmed meson: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partial wave"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"current: hadronic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling constant: axial"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: axial"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: confinement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"current: (2quark)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":21,"citation_count":20,"authors":["Henriksson, K.O.E.","Lahde, T.A.","Nyfalt, C.J.","Riska, D.O."]}

Results are obtained for $S+S$ and $Au+Au$ collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. At RHIC energies the gluonic dissociation of the charmonium is found to be equally important for both the systems while the screening of the interaction plays a significant role only for the larger systems. At LHC energies the Debye mechanism is found to dominate for both the systems. While considering the suppression of directly produced $\\Upsilon$ at LHC energies, we find that only the gluonic dissociation mechanism comes into play for the initial conditions taken from the self screened parton cascade model in these studies. Thus we find that a systematic study of quarkonium suppression for systems of varying dimensions can help identify the source and the extent of the suppression.","created":"2000-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"12.38M"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sulfur"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"J/psi(3100): hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: screening"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dissociation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charmonium"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"screening: Debye"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CERN LHC Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Brookhaven RHIC Coll"}],"num_refs":16,"citation_count":40,"authors":["Patra, Binoy Krishna","Srivastava, Dinesh Kumar"]}

The superpotential of this model contains no dimensionful parameters, thus solving the mu-problem of the MSSM. A global discrete R-symmetry, forbidding the cubic singlet self-interaction, imposed on the complete theory, guarantees its stability with respect to generated higher-order tadpoles of the singlet and solves both the domain wall and Peccei-Quinn axion problems. We give the free parameters of the model and display some general constraints on them. A particular attention is devoted to the neutralino sector where a (quasi-pure) singlino appears to be always the LSP of the model, leading to additional cascades, involving the NLSP -> LSP transition, compared with the MSSM. We then present the upper bounds on the masses of the lightest and next-to-lightest -- when the lightest is an invisible singlet -- CP-even Higgs bosons, including the full one-loop and dominant two-loop corrections. These bounds are found to be much higher than the equivalent ones in the MSSM.

{"title":"The Spherical relativistic detonation of scalaron stars","abstract":"Now the hypothesis of existence of scalar fields of a various nature and energy density in the modern Universe is intensively explored. It can explain a nature of the dark (non- baryon) matter in the Universe and an existence of positive $\\Lambda $-term (see e.g. gr-qc/9904398). One of component of such field has a cluster nature and organizes in the closed gravitational configurations from galactic scales up to relativistic microscopic stars. In the authors paper astro-ph/0008334 the hypothesis of detonation of such fields was considered. As a result of phase transition behind the wavefront a relativistic plasma of high energy density can appear. This process is similar to a relativistic detonation and it can create macroscopic fireballs sufficient for an explanation of the phenomenon of gamma-ray bursts (see e.g. the review astro-ph/9907392). In astro-ph/0008334 it was supposed that the front of such ''detonation'' wave is entered by the flow of scalar fields with constant energy density. If the size of the formed plasma configuration is commensurable with the size of scalaron cluster, this hypothesis is not correct. It is necessary to take into account a modification of the energy density of the scalar field from centre to a periphery. It is changes the dynamics of the fireball on principle. The indicated problem in framework of special relativity is considered in this paper.","created":"2000-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":5,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics: matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"velocity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics: missing-mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fireball"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"relativity theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"star: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":3,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Folomeev, V.","Gurovich, V.","Usupov, R."]}

The degrees of freedom in the effective theory are magnetic vortices. They play a similar role in confining dynamics to the role played by pions and sigma in the chiral symmetry breaking dynamics. I give explicit derivation of the effective theory in 2+1 dimensional weekly coupled confining models and give arguments that it remains qualitatively the same in strongly coupled 2+1 dimensional gluodynamics. Confinement in this effective theory is a very simple classical statement about long range interaction between topological solitons, which follows by a simple direct classical calculation from the structure of the effective Lagrangian.

In this approach, we scan the O(1) coefficients randomly. We argue that this is the correct approach when the fundamental theory is sufficiently complicated. Assuming there is no physical distinction among three generations of neutrinos, the probability distributions in MNS mixing angles can be predicted independent of the choice of the measure. This is because the mixing angles are distributed according to the Haar measure of the Lie groups whose elements diagonalize the mass matrices. The near-maximal mixings, as observed in the atmospheric neutrino data and as required in the LMA solution to the solar neutrino problem, are highly probable. A small hierarchy between the Delta m^2 for the atmospheric and the solar neutrinos is obtained very easily; the complex seesaw case gives a hierarchy of a factor of 20 as the most probable one, even though this conclusion is more measure-dependent. U_{e3} has to be just below the current limit from the CHOOZ experiment. The CP-violating parameter sin delta is preferred to be maximal.

Standard model matter multiplets and a supersymmetry-breaking (or ``hidden'') sector are confined to opposite four-dimensional boundaries while gauge multiplets live in the bulk. The hidden sector does not contain a singlet and the dominant contribution to gaugino masses is via anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Scalar masses get contributions from both anomaly mediation and a tiny hard breaking of supersymmetry by operators on the hidden-sector boundary. These operators contribute to scalar masses at one loop and in most of parameter space, their contribution dominates. Thus it is easy to make all squared scalar masses positive. As no additional fields or symmetries are required below the Planck scale, we consider this the simplest working model of anomaly mediation. The gaugino spectrum is left untouched and the phenomenology of the model is roughly similar to anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking with a universal scalar mass added. We identify the main differences in the spectrum between this model and other approaches.

{"title":"A Critical look at catastrophe risk assessments","abstract":"Recent papers by Busza et al. (BJSW) and Dar et al. (DDH) argue that astrophysical data can be used to establish small bounds on the risk of a ``killer strangelet'' catastrophe scenario in the RHIC and ALICE collider experiments. DDH and other commentators (initially including BJSW) suggested that these empirical bounds alone do give sufficient reassurance. This seems unsupportable when the bounds are expressed in terms of expected cost -- a good measure, according to standard risk analysis arguments. For example, DDH's main bound, $p_{\\rm catastrophe} < 2 \\times 10^{-8}$, implies only that the expectation value of the number of deaths is bounded by 120. This paper reappraises the DDH and BJSW risk bounds by comparing risk policy in other areas. For example, it is noted that, even if highly risk tolerant assumptions are made and no value is placed on the lives of future generations, a catastrophe risk no higher than $\\approx 10^{-15}$ per year would be required for consistency with established policy for radiation hazard risk minimization. It is concluded that the costs of small risks of catastrophe have been significantly underestimated by BJSW (initially), by DDH and by other commentators.

To our knowledge this is a first successful simulation of Skyrmion-anti-Skyrmion annihilation which follows through to the point where the energy is carried by outgoing meson waves. We encounter instabilities similar to those encountered is earlier calculations, but in our case these are not fatal and we are able to simulate through this process with a global energy loss of less than 8%, and to identify robust features of the final radiation pattern. The system passes through a singular configuration at the time of half-annihilation. This is followed by the onset of fast oscillations which are superimposed on the smoother process which leads to the appearence of outgoing spherical waves. We investigate the two prominent features of this process, the proliferation of small, fast oscillations, and the singular intermediate configuration. We find that our equations of motion allow for a regime in which the amplitude of certain small perturbations increases exponentially. This regime is similar but not identical to the situation pointed out earlier regarding the original Skyrme model.

{"title":"Dynamical quark effects in QCD on the lattice: Results from the CP-PACS","abstract":"Results of a systematic lattice QCD simulation with two degenerate flavors of sea quarks, identified as dynamical u and d quarks, are presented. The simulation was performed on a dedicated parallel computer, called CP-PACS, developed at the University of Tsukuba. Clear dynamical quark effects are observed in the light hadron mass spectrum and in the light quark masses: In the light hadron mass spectrum, major parts of the discrepancy between quenched QCD and experiment are shown to be removed by introducing two flavors of dynamical quarks. For the averaged mass of u and d quarks, we find $m_{ud}^{\\bar{\\rm MS}}(2{\\rm GeV}) = 3.44^{+0.14}_{-0.22}$ MeV using the $\\pi$ and $\\rho$ meson masses as physical input, and for the s quark mass, we obtain $m_{s}^{\\bar{\\rm MS}}(2{\\rm GeV}) = 88^{+4}_{-6}$ MeV or $90^{+5}_{-11}$ MeV with the K or $\\phi$ meson mass as additional input. These values are about 20-30% smaller than the previous estimates in the quenched approximation.

We use analyticity of $\\pi\\pi$ partial wave amplitudes to show that they must have the form of a coherent sum of Breit-Wigner amplitudes with complex coefficients and a complex coherent background. The assumption of additivity of Breit-Wigner phases restricts the partial waves to analytical functions with very specific form of residues of Breit-Wigner poles. We argue that the general form provided by the analyticity is more appropriate in fits to data to determine resonance parameters. The partial wave unitarity can be imposed using the modern methods of constrained optimization. We discuss unitarity and the production amplitudes in $\\pi N\\to\\pi\\pi N$ and use analyticity in the dipion mass variable to justify the common practice of writing the production amplitudes as a coherent sum of Breit-Wigner amplitudes with free complex coefficients and a complex coherent background in fits to mass spectra with interfering resonances.","created":"2000-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":26,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi pi: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi nucleon: inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unitarity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interference: resonance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"isospin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: Breit-Wigner"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partial wave analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dispersion relation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"analytic properties"}],"num_refs":34,"citation_count":12,"authors":["Svec, M."]}

{"title":"Can neutrinos and high-energy particles test Finsler metric of space-time?","abstract":"The Finsler-relativistic metric function $F(g;R)$ and the associated Hamiltonian function $H(g;P)$, being considered together with explicit Finslerian special-relativistic kinematic transformations, give rise to a self-consistent and rigorous framework upon which corrections to Lorentz-relativistic quantities can properly be evaluated. The concomitant relations generalize their Lorentzian prototypes through the presence of a single characteristic parameter, ~$g$, so that the explicated Particle-Antiparticle Asymmetry, as well as the search for possible distinction between the pseudo-Euclidean Light Geometry and the Finsler-relativistic Neutrino Geometry, can well be traced in terms of this parameter. At any fixed rest-mass value $m$ and $g\\ne0$, the dependences of energy on three-dimensional momentum prove to be of different forms, as given by the respective functions $E^{(+)}(g;m;|{\\bf P}|)$ and $E^{(-)}(g;m;|{\\bf P}|)$, for particles and antiparticles. This splitting of the mass-shell, as well as various entailed Finslerian approximations with respect to $g$, can naturally be proposed for experimental study in order to obtain estimations on $g$. Since neutrinos and antineutrinos are uncomposed neat particles, measuring the difference between their velocities seems to be the best way for testing implied Finslerian corrections to conventional Lorentzian quantities. Accelerators which can produce neutrinos and antineutrinos are ideal instruments to gain this aim. The known measurements led to the conclusion that the difference $<0.7\\cdot 10^{-4}~(95%~CL)$, while announced future long baseline neutrino experiments probably raise the sensitivity to approach the high level of $\\sim 10^{-9}$.","created":"2000-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: Finsler"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"relativity theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transformation: Lorentz"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: velocity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":93,"citation_count":9,"authors":["Asanov, G.S."]}

Molecular-dynamical simulations were performed for a system of hadrons in a box with periodic boundary conditions. Starting from an initial state composed of only nucleons with a uniform phase-space distribution, the evolution takes place through interactions such as collisions, productions and absorptions. The system approaches a stationary state of baryons, mesons and their resonances, which is characterized by the value of the exponent in the energy distribution common to the different particles, i.e., the temperature. After the equilibration, thermodynamic quantities, such as the energy density, particle density, entropy and pressure are calculated. Above T - m_pi, the obtained equation of state exhibits a significant deviation from the naive mixed free gas model. Large values of the entropy per baryon are also notable. In our system, the excitation of heavy baryon resonances and meson production are enhanced simultaneously, and the increase of the temperature becomes moderate, but a Hagedorn-type artificial temperature saturation does not occur. The pressure exhibits a linear dependence on the energy density.","created":"2000-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":29,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gas: hadron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":37,"citation_count":9,"authors":["Sasaki, Nobuo"]}

We give compact formulae which include all potentially large higher-order contributions. We find that tan(beta) terms at the next-to-leading order do not only appear from the Hall-Rattazzi-Sarid effect (the modified relation between the bottom mass and Yukawa coupling), but also from an analogous effect in the top-quark Yukawa coupling.

{"title":"Solar neutrino results and violation of the equivalence principle: An Analysis of the existing data and predictions for SNO","abstract":"Violation of the Equivalence Principle (VEP) can lead to neutrino oscillation through the non-diagonal coupling of neutrino flavor eigenstates with the gravitational field. The neutrino energy dependence of this oscillation probability is different from that of the usual mass-mixing neutrino oscillations. In this work we explore, in detail, the viability of the VEP hypothesis as a solution to the solar neutrino problem in a two generation scenario with both the active and sterile neutrino alternatives, choosing these states to be massless. To obtain the best-fit values of the oscillation parameters we perform a chi square analysis for the total rates of solar neutrinos seen at the Chlorine (Homestake), Gallium (Gallex and SAGE), Kamiokande, and SuperKamiokande (SK) experiments. We find that the goodness of these fits is never satisfactory. It markedly improves, especially for VEP transformation to sterile neutrinos, if the Chlorine result is excluded from the analysis. The 1117-day SK data for recoil electron spectrum are also examined for signals of VEP oscillations. For these fits, we consider variations of the Standard Solar Model by allowing the absolute normalizations of the 8B and hep neutrinos to vary. Here the fits are quite good but the best fit values of the parameters are rather different from those from the total rates fits. A combined fit to the total rates and recoil electron spectrum data is also performed. We present the 90% confidence limit contours for all the three analyses mentioned above. The best-fit parameters obtained from the recoil electron spectrum and the combined analysis of rate and spectrum are used to predict the charge current and scattering electron spectrum at SNO.","created":"2000-10-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"family: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"equivalence principle: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":45,"citation_count":21,"authors":["Majumdar, Debasish","Raychaudhuri, Amitava","Sil, Arunansu"]}

{"title":"The Heavy neutral Higgs signature in the gamma gamma ---> Z Z process","abstract":"If the Standard Model (SM) Higgs particle is sufficiently heavy, then its contribution to gamma gamma to Z Z should be largely imaginary, interfering with the also predominantly imaginary SM \"background\" generated by the W-loop. For standard model Higgs masses in the region 200 \\lsim m_H \\lsim 500 GeV, this interference is found to be constructive and increasing the Higgs signal. In the minimal SUSY case an interference effect should also appear for the contribution of the heavier CP-even neutral Higgs boson H^0, provided it is sufficiently heavy. The effect is somewhat reduced though, by the smallness of the H^0 width and the gamma gamma and ZZ branching ratios. The interference is again found to be constructive for part of the parameter space corresponding to sfermion masses at the TeV scale and maximal stop mixing. For both the SM and SUSY cases, regions of the parameter space exist though, where the interference may be destructive. It is therefore essential to take these effects into account when searching for possible scalar Higgs-like candidates.

A simple two component neutrino oscillation with $\\Delta m^{2}$ in the range of 10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{-2}$ eV$^{2}$ seems unable to account for the observations.","created":"2000-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Victoria 2000/09/18"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flux"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/e"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/mu"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"geophysics: magnetic field"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: KAMIOKANDE"}],"num_refs":7,"citation_count":0,"authors":["LoSecco, J.M."]}

{"title":"From Hard to soft diffraction and return","abstract":"The long standing mystery of smallness of diffractive dissociation of hadrons to large effective masses (the Pomeron-proton cross section is only 2 mb) witnesses that the gluonic clouds of valence quarks are so small (r_0=0.3fm) that soft interaction hardly resolves those gluons (diffraction is \\propto r_0^4). A color-dipole light-cone (LC) approach is developed which incorporates a strong nonperturbative interaction of the LC gluons. The energy dependent part of the total hadronic cross section is calculated in a parameter-free way employing the nonperturbative LC wave functions of the quark-gluon Fock states. It rises with energy as s^\\Delta, and we predict \\Delta=0.17 +/- 0.01, as well as the normalization. However, the energy independent part of the cross section related to inelastic collisions with no gluon radiated (gluons are not resolved) cannot be calculated reliably and we treat it as an adjustable parameter which is fixed fitting just one experimental point for total cross section. Then the energy dependence of the total cross section (the Pomeron part) and the elastic slope are fully predicted, as well as the effective Pomeron trajectory in impact parameter space, in a good agreement with data. These results naturally explain the x-dependence of the diffractive DIS observed at HERA. Although diffraction is expected to be dominated by soft interactions the observed effective \\Delta is about twice as large as one (0.08) known for total cross sections. Diffractive excitations of large effective mass correspond to diffractive gluon radiation and should be associated with our calculated \\Delta.","created":"2000-12-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Cetraro 2000/09/02"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"diffraction: dissociation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: pomeron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: pomeron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: bremsstrahlung"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: light cone"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unitarity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"total cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section: slope"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: impact parameter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":33,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Kopeliovich, B.Z."]}

{"title":"Markov-Yukawa transversality principle and 3-D - 4-D interlinkage of Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes","abstract":"This article is designed to focus attention on the Markov-Yukawa Transversality Principle (MYTP) as a novel paradigm for an exact 3D-4D interlinkage between the corresponding BSE amplitudes, with a closely parallel treatment of $q{\\bar q}$ and $qqq$ systems, stemming from a common 4-fermion Lagrangian mediated by gluon (vector)-like exchange. This unique feature of MYTP owes its origin to a Lorentz- covariant 3D support to the BS kernel, which acts as a sort of `gauge principle' and distinguishes it from most other 3D approaches to strong interaction dynamics. Some of the principal approaches in the latter category are briefly reviewed so as to set the (less familiar) MYTP in their context. Two specific types of MYTP which provide 3D support to the BSE kernel, are considered: a) Covariant Instantaneity Ansatz (CIA); b) Covariant LF/NP ansatz (Cov.LF). Both lead to formaly identical 3D BSE reductions but produce sharply different 4D structures: Under CIA, the 4D loop integrals suffer from Lorentz mismatch of the vertex functions, leading to ill-defined time-like momentum integrals, but Cov LF is free from this disease. This is illustrated by the pion form factor under Cov LF. The reconstruction of the 4D $qqq$ wave function is achieved by Green's function techniques. PACS: 11.10 st ; 12.38 Lg ; 13.40.Fn.

At leading order, the parallel- perpendicular asymmetry in azimuthal distributions of both charm and bottom quark is predicted to be about 20% in a wide region of initial energy. Using the soft gluon resummation formalism, we have calculated the next-to-leading order corrections to the asymmetry to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. It is shown that radiative corrections practically do not affect the Born predictions for the azimuthal asymmetry at energies of the fixed target experiments. Both leading and next-to-leading order predictions for the asymmetry are insensitive to within few percent to theoretical uncertainties in the QCD input parameters: $m_{Q}$, $\\mu_{R}$, $\\mu_{F}$, $\\Lambda_{QCD}$ and in the gluon distribution function. Our analysis shows that nonperturbative corrections to a $B$-meson azimuthal asymmetry due to the gluon transverse motion in the target are negligible.

{"title":"Gluon, quark and hadron masses from a modified perturbative QCD","abstract":"The development of a Modified Perturbation Theory for QCD, introduced in previous works, is continued. The gluon propagator is modified as consequence of a soft gluon pairs condensate in the vacuum. The modified Feynman rules for $\\alpha=1$ are shown, and some physical magnitudes calculated with them. The mean value of $G^{2}$, gluon masses and the effective potential are calculated up to the $g^2$ order, improving previous calculations. In connection with the gluon self-energy it follows that the gluonic mass shell becomes tachyonic in the considered approximation. The constituent quarks masses, produced by the influence of the condensate, are also calculated. Results of the order of 1/3 of the nucleon mass, are obtained for the constituent masses of the up and down quarks. In addition, the predicted flavour dependence of the calculated quarks masses turns out to be the appropriate to reproduce the spectrum of the ground states within the various groups of hadronic resonances, through the simple addition of their constituent quark masses. Finally, the generalization of the theory for arbitrary values of the $\\alpha$ gauge parameter is explored.","created":"2001-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":44,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":32,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Rigol, Marcos"]}

{"title":"Ruling out the Weinberg model of spontaneous CP violation","abstract":"There have been many declarations of the death of the Weinberg model of spontaneous CP violation. Previous studies, before the recent measurements of $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$, indicated that the model could not accommodate the experimental values on $\\epsilon$ in $K^0-\\bar K^0$ mixing, the neutron electric dipole moment (EDM), the branching ratio of $b\\to s \\gamma$ and the upper limit on $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$. We point out that these studies were based on optimistic estimates of the uncertainties in the calculations and that when more realistic estimates of these errors are used the Weinberg model cannot be conclusively ruled out from these considerations alone. Here we use these realistic error estimates to analyze the present situation of the Weinberg model. The latest results from Belle and BaBar on $\\sin 2 \\beta$ allow the small values of this parameter which occur naturally in the Weinberg model. However, in this model, the recently measured value of $\\Re(\\epsilon'/\\epsilon) = (1.92\\pm 0.25)\\times 10^{-3}$ cannot be made compatible with the branching ratio $B(b\\to s \\gamma) = (3.15\\pm0.54)\\times 10^{-4}$.

With the further assumption that the breaking of this extended democracy is universal for all leptonic mass matrices, a large mixing in the 2-3 sector can be obtained and is linked to the seesaw mechanism, together with the existence of a strong hierarchy in the masses of right-handed neutrinos.

{"title":"The Electroweak phase transition","abstract":"The electroweak phase transition provides the most attractive framework to account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Comparing results of perturbative and nonperturbative studies is not straightforward, however, due to the different coupling constant definitions. The perturbative one stems from the $\\bar{\\mathrm{MS}}$ subtraction scheme, while the nonperturbative one uses the static quark potential. The momentum-space perturbative static potential is calculated in the SU(2)--Higgs model, and is Fourier transformed into coordinate space. Based on the connection between the coupling constants, two-loop perturbative and 4-dimensional lattice simulation results are contrasted. The thermodynamical parameters of the phase transition indicate that perturbative results are reliable only for low Higgs masses, far from the endpoint. The value of the endpoint can be refined to $72.1\\pm1.4$ GeV. The Higgs mass range for which dimensional reduction yields reliable results is identified. As an extension of the standard model, the MSSM is also studied. Some useful trends are indicated by a simple one-loop perturbative approach: baryogenesis requirements are more easily met if the stop is lighter thanthe top; colour-breaking phase transition may be possible, etc. In order to perform 4D nonperturbative studies the supercomputer PMS was built at E\\\"otv\\\"os University. The results and the techniques of the simulations of the bosonic sector of the MSSM performed on PMS are presented. A phase diagram is given, the bubble wall is studied.

In this article we show that such a light sbottom cannot be ruled out by the constraints from the electroweak precision data and the present bound on the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass at LEP. It is inferred that a light sbottom scenario requires in general a relatively light scalar top quark whose mass is typically about the top-quark mass. It is also shown that under these conditions the lightest CP-even Higgs boson decays predominantly into scalar bottom quarks in most of the parameter space and that its mass is restricted to m_h ~< 123 GeV.","created":"2000-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: validity test"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":23,"citation_count":51,"authors":["Carena, Marcela","Heinemeyer, S.","Wagner, C.E.M.","Weiglein, G."]}

{"title":"Can neutrinos probe extra dimensions?","abstract":"We conjecture that the topological structure of the gauge symmetries required by the Calabi-Yau vacuum and the dualities in string/D-branes considered in the world with some additional dimensions can lead to an extension of the main principles of the Special Theory of Relativity. The link between the topological structure of the vacuum and the, hierarchy of the gauge symmetries could be checked by the existence of the ``almost massless'', ''sterile'' particles. These particles could have flying properties different from the standard predictions of the STR. It is natural to consider this property for neutrinos, known up to now ``$U(1)_{em}$ sterile'' particles. Here we discuss two such effects depending on the possible existence of large and/or small extra dimensions and what is the maximal speed for both cases. The effect of large extra dimensions can be directly connected with the existence of a hidden boost, $c_{hid} >> c_{em}$, excited by new global dimensions and can lead to the monotonous rise of the neutrino velocity at high energies, $v_{\\nu} > c$. The effect of small extra dimensions, universal with respect to all particles, can be connected with the gravitation recoils of the propagation of neutrino in the space-time vacuum-foam and it leads to the effect of diminishing the neutrino velocity at high energies. We propose to check these conjectures for neutrinos of different energies and species. Limits for existing neutrino data and expected sensitivities of possible experiments for accelerator - produced neutrinos are considered. It is pointed out that CERN has the unique opportunity of measuring the indicated effects.","created":"2000-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":9,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: velocity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"topology"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"duality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":38,"citation_count":24,"authors":["Ammosov, Vladimir","Volkov, Guennadi"]}

{"title":"The Fractal geometry of critical systems","abstract":"We investigate the geometry of a critical system undergoing a second order thermal phase transition. Using a local description for the dynamics characterizing the system at the critical point T=Tc, we reveal the formation of clusters with fractal geometry, where the term cluster is used to describe regions with a nonvanishing value of the order parameter. We show that, treating the cluster as an open subsystem of the entire system, new instanton-like configurations dominate the statistical mechanics of the cluster. We study the dependence of the resulting fractal dimension on the embedding dimension and the scaling properties (isothermal critical exponent) of the system. Taking into account the finite size effects we are able to calculate the size of the critical cluster in terms of the total size of the system, the critical temperature and the effective coupling of the long wavelength interaction at the critical point. We also show that the size of the cluster has to be identified with the correlation length at criticality. Finally, within the framework of the mean field approximation, we extend our local considerations to obtain a global description of the system.","created":"2000-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"geometry: fractal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cluster"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: finite size"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mean field approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"statistical mechanics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation: length"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling"}],"num_refs":11,"citation_count":15,"authors":["Antoniou, N.G.","Contoyiannis, Y.F.","Diakonos, F.K."]}
{"title":"Solar neutrino oscillation from large extra dimensions","abstract":"A plausible explanation for the existence of additional light sterile neutrinos is that they correspond to modulini, fermionic partners of moduli, which propagate in new large dimensions. We discuss the phenomenological implications of such states and show that solar neutrino oscillation is well described by small angle MSW oscillation to the tower of Kaluza Klein states associated with the modulini. In the optimal case the recoil electron energy spectrum agrees precisely with the measured one, in contrast to the single sterile neutrino case which is disfavoured. We also consider how all oscillation phenomena can be explained in a model including bulk neutrino states. In particular, we show that a naturally maximal mixing for atmospheric neutrinos can be easily obtained.","created":"2000-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum gravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: space-time"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":41,"citation_count":103,"authors":["Lukas, Andre","Ramond, Pierre","Romanino, Andrea","Ross, Graham G."]}

Models with an IMH already in place at the GUT scale have been shown to be constrained in that for many model parameter choices, the top squark squared mass is driven to negative values. We delineate regions of parameter space where viable models with a GUT scale IMH can be generated. We find that larger values of GUT scale first and second generation scalar masses act to suppress third generation scalars, leading to acceptable solutions if GUT scale gaugino masses are large enough. We show examples of viable models and comment on their characteristic features. For example, in these models the gluino mass is bounded from below, and effectively decouples, whilst third generation scalars remain at sub-TeV levels. While possibly fulfilling criteria of naturalness, these models present challenges for detection at future pp and e^+e^- collider experiments.","created":"2000-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":16,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":58,"citation_count":33,"authors":["Baer, Howard","Balazs, Csaba","Mercadante, Pedro","Tata, Xerxes","Wang, Yili"]}

{"title":"Low scale and gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking at the Fermilab Tevatron Run II","abstract":"The prospects for discovering and studying signals of low-scale supersymmetry breaking models at the Tevatron Run II and beyond are explored. These models include gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking as the most compelling and concrete realization, but more generally are distinguished by the presence of a nearly massless Goldstino as the lightest supersymmetric particle. The next-lightest supersymmetric particle(s) (NLSP) decays to its partner and the Goldstino. Depending on the supersymmetry breaking scale, these decays can occur promptly or on a scale comparable to or larger than the size of a detector. A systematic analysis based on a classification in terms of the identity of the NLSP and its decay length is presented. The various scenarios are discussed in terms of signatures and possible event selection criteria. The Run II and beyond discovery and exclusion reaches, including the effects of background, are detailed for the most compelling cases. In addition to standard event selection criteria based on missing energy and photons, leptons, jets, taus, tagged b-jets, or reconstructed Z-bosons, more exotic signals of metastable NLSPs such as displaced photons, large negative impact parameter tracks, kink tracks, both opposite and same-sign highly ionizing tracks, time of flight measurements, charge-changing tracks, charge-exchange tracks, and same-sign di-top events are investigated.

Within this framework, we discuss the lepton-flavour violating (LFV) processes mu -> e gamma, mu -> eee, and mu -> e conversion in nuclei. We make a detailed study of the observables related to LFV in different RPV models, and compare them to the expectations of R-conserving supersymmetry with heavy right-handed neutrinos. We show that the predictions are vastly different and uniquely characterise each model, thus providing a powerful framework for experimentally distinguishing between different theories of LFV. Besides the obvious possibility of amplified tree-level generation of mu -> eee and mu -> e conversion in nuclei, we find that even in the case where these processes arise at the one-loop level, their rates are comparable to that of mu -> e gamma, in clear contrast to the predictions of R-conserving models. We conclude that in order to distinguish between the different models, such a combined study of all the LFV processes is necessary, and that measuring P-odd asymmetries in polarised mu -> eee can play a decisive role. We also comment on the intriguing possibility of RPV models yielding a large T-odd asymmetry in the decay of polarised mu -> eee.","created":"2000-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":35,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: electromagnetic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron muon: transition"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear physics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tree approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time reversal: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: penguin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon --> electron photon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon --> 3electron"}],"num_refs":125,"citation_count":97,"authors":["de Gouvea, Andre","Lola, Smaragda","Tobe, Kazuhiro"]}

The original gauge field coupling is completely eliminated, even in the presence of degenerate states connected by this interaction.

{"title":"Radion mediated supersymmetry breaking","abstract":"We point out that in supersymmetric theories with extra dimensions, radius stabilization can give rise to a VEV for the $F$ component of the radius modulus. This gives an important contribution to supersymmetry breaking of fields that propagate in the bulk. A particularly attractive class of models is obtained if the standard-model gauge fields propagate in the bulk, while the quark and lepton fields are localized on a brane. This leads to gaugino mediated supersymmetry breaking without the need for singlets in the hidden sector.

This definition stems solely from an effective proper photon-neutrino one-loop vertex, with no reference to box or self-energy contributions. The role of the $WW$ box in this construction is critically examined. In particular it is shown that the exclusion of the effective WW box from the definition of the neutrino charge radius is not a matter of convention but is in fact dynamically realized when the target-fermions are right-handedly polarized. In this way we obtain a unique decomposition of effective self-energies, vertices, and boxes, which separately respect electroweak gauge invariance. We elaborate on the tree-level origin of the mechanism which enforces at one-loop level massive cancellations among the longitudinal momenta appearing in the Feynman diagrams, and in particular those associated with the non-abelian character of the theory. Various issues related to the known connection between the pinch technique and the Background Field Method are further clarified. Explicit closed expressions for the neutrino charge radius are reported.","created":"2000-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":26,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge fixing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator: renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vertex function: (neutrino photon)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background field"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":51,"citation_count":69,"authors":["Bernabeu, J.","Cabral-Rosetti, L.G.","Papavassiliou, J.","Vidal, J."]}

On the contrary, one expects bulk curvature terms that violate the SO(3,1) isometry at early epochs, leading to a violation of Lorentz invariance on our brane. Demanding that the Lorentz noninvariant terms are small leads to a new ``flatness'' problem, not solved by the usual formulation of inflation. Furthermore, unlike in four dimensions, the Lorentz violations induced from the bulk curvature cannot always be removed as the infrared cutoff is taken arbitrarily large. This means that the equivalence principle in higher dimensions does not guarantee the equivalence principle in dimensionally reduced theories.

{"title":"Meson loop effects in the NJL model at zero and nonzero temperature","abstract":"We compare two different possibilities to include meson-loop corrections in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model: a strict 1/N_c-expansion in next-to-leading order and a non-perturbative scheme corresponding to a one-meson-loop approximation to the effective action. Both schemes are consistent with chiral symmetry, in particular with the Goldstone theorem and the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation. The numerical part at zero temperature focuses on the pion and the rho-meson sector. For the latter the meson-loop-corrections are crucial in order to include the dominant rho -> pipi-decay channel, while the standard Hartree + RPA approximation only contains unphysical qqbar-decay channels.

{"title":"The Abundance of relativistic axions in a flaton model of Peccei-Quinn symmetry","abstract":"Flaton models of Peccei-Quinn symmetry have good particle physics motivation, and are likely to cause thermal inflation leading to a well-defined cosmology. They can solve the $\\mu$ problem, and generate viable neutrino masses. Canonical flaton models predict an axion decay constant F_a of order 10^{10} GeV and generic flaton models give F_a of order 10^9 GeV as required by observation. The axion is a good candidate for cold dark matter in all cases, because its density is diluted by flaton decay if F_a is bigger than 10^{12} GeV. In addition to the dark matter axions, a population of relativistic axions is produced by flaton decay, which at nucleosynthesis is equivalent to some number \\delta N_\\nu of extra neutrino species. Focussing on the canonical model, containing three flaton particles and two flatinos, we evaluate all of the flaton-flatino-axion interactions and the corresponding axionic decay rates. They are compared with the dominant hadronic decay rates, for both DFSZ and KSVZ models. These formulas provide the basis for a precise calculation of the equivalent \\delta N_\\nu in terms of the parameters (masses and couplings). The KSVZ case is probably already ruled out by the existing bound \\delta N_\\nu\\lsim 1. The DFSZ case is allowed in a significant region of parameter space, and will provide a possible explanation for any future detection of nonzero $\\delta N_\\nu$.","created":"2000-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: Peccei-Quinn"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: flat direction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: flaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: flatino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"axion: relativistic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"LSP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: SIMP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"resonance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: flaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: flaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: flatino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":68,"citation_count":44,"authors":["Chun, Eung Jin","Comelli, Denis","Lyth, David H."]}

The flaton fields which break PQ symmetry are accompanied by flatinos, and the lightest flatino (the LSP) can be the stable, while the decay of the lightest neutralino (the NLSP) might be visible at colliders with a low axion scale. We examine the cosmology of these models, involving thermal inflation just after the PQ phase transition. The branching ratio of flatons into axions must be small so as not to interfere with nucleosynthesis, and flatons must not decay into the LSP or it will be over-abundant. We explore a simple model,with light flatons which can decay into $Z$ or $W$ bosons, or into a light Higgs ($h^0$) plus a $Z$ boson, to show that such features can be realized in a wide range of parameter space. The mass of the NLSP can be as low as $(m_{h^0}+m_Z)/2$, with an axion scale of order $10^{10}$ GeV and a final reheat temperature typically of order $10\\GeV$. Then, the flatino LSP is a good dark matter candidate because the reheat temperature can be high enough to allow its production from the decay of the thermalized LSP, while low enough to prevent its overproduction from the decay of sfermions.","created":"2000-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction: CP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"LSP: flatino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flaton: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flaton: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"axion: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interference: (Higgs particle flaton)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":35,"citation_count":35,"authors":["Chun, Eung Jin","Kim, Hang Bae","Lyth, David H."]}

{"title":"Quark combinatorics and meson production ratios in hadronic Z0 decays","abstract":"Rich experimental data accumulated in the past few years in the hadronic $Z^0$ decays allow one to check the quark combinatorics relations for a new type of processes, namely: quark jets in the decays $Z^0 \\to q\\bar q \\to hadrons$. In this paper we review quark combinatorics rules for the yields of vector and pseudoscalar mesons, $V/P$, in the central and fragmentation regions of the hadronic $Z^0$ decays. It is stressed that in the central region a direct verification of quark combinatorics rules is rather problematic because of a considerable background related to the decay of highly excited resonances; however such a verification is possible in the fragmentation region, at $x_{hadron} \\sim 0.5-1$, where the contribution of resonance decays is suppressed due to the rapid decrease of spectra with increasing $x_{hadron}$. It is shown that the experimental data in the fragmentation region for $\\rho^0/\\pi^0$ and $p/\\pi^+$ are in a reasonable agreement with the predictions of quark combinatorics. The ratios of the heavy meson yields, $B^*/B$ and $D^*/D$, are also discussed: the data demonstrate a good agreement with the quark combinatorial results. We analyse the structure of the suppression parameters for strange and heavy quark productions in soft processes and estimate their order of magnitudes in the multiperipheral processes; the ratio $K^{\\pm}/\\pi^{\\pm}$ at $x_{hadron}\\sim 0.5-0.8$ and production probabilities of the $c\\bar c$ and $b \\bar b$ mesons are in a good agreement with the estimates.","created":"2000-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pseudoscalar meson"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"yield: ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: jet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"central region"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: fragmentation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: strangeness"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"heavy quark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section: x-dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":57,"citation_count":7,"authors":["Anisovich, V.V.","Nikonov, V.A.","Nyiri, J."]}

{"title":"Looking for novel CP violating effects in $\\bar{B} \\to K^{*} \\ell^+$ lepton-","abstract":"The CP-violating asymmetries in the exclusive decay B->K^*l^+l^- (l=e,mu,tau) are predicted to be exceedingly small in the standard model (SM), thereby offering an opportunity to assess various new-physics scenarios. We derive quantitative predictions for various integrated observables in B->K^*mu^+mu^- decay in the presence of physics beyond the SM with additional CP phases and an extended operator basis. In particular, a model-independent analysis of CP asymmetries that require the presence of unitarity phases, in addition to CP violation, is performed. We find that in the low dimuon invariant mass region 2m_mu<M_{mu^+mu^-}<M_{J/psi}, the CP asymmetries are highly suppressed by small dynamical phases, assuming that new physics is unlikely to significantly alter the Wilson coefficients of the operators governing two-body hadronic B decays. Taking into account current experimental data on the measured b->s gamma rate and the upper limit on BR(B^0->K^{*0}mu^+mu^-), CP-violating effects of a few per cent are estimated, even in the presence of new physics with CP phases of O(1). By contrast, in the high dimuon invariant mass region M_{psi'}<M_{mu^+mu^-}<(M_B-M_{K^*}) significant CP-violating effects are possible. Given a branching ratio of 1.8 x 10^{-6}, the CP asymmetries can be quite substantial (\\sim 20% or more), and thus may serve as a means of discovering physics transcending the SM.","created":"2000-08-21T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-B: rare decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-B: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K*(892)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-B: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Hamiltonian: operator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"new interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-B: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum: dimuon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon-: angular distribution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-B --> K*(892) lepton antilepton"}],"num_refs":37,"citation_count":71,"authors":["Kruger, F.","Lunghi, E."]}

We propose that the self-interacting dark matter is composed from the glueballs of the hidden sector non-Abelian gauge group, while the hidden matter states exist in vector-like representation and decouple from the light spectrum. It is shown that these glueballs are semi-stable with the life-time larger than the present age of the Universe, if their mass is 1 GeV or less. The constraint on their abundance today suggests that the energy was stored in the hidden sector soon after inflation. This imposes an upper limit on the reheating temperature.

{"title":"Jet quenching versus jet enhancement: A Quantitative study of the BDMPS-Z gluon radiation spectrum","abstract":"We study the gluon radiation spectrum off a hard in-medium produced quark in the multiple soft rescattering formalism of Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigne-Schiff, and of Zakharov (BDMPS-Z). Its dependence on the quark and gluon energy, on the gluon transverse momentum, on the in-medium pathlength and on the rescattering properties of the nuclear medium is analyzed quantitatively. The two components of gluon radiation, the hard vacuum radiation associated to the quark production vertex, and the medium-induced rescattering contribution interfer destructively. For small spatial extensions of the medium, this destructive interference overcompensates the hard vacuum radiation, and the total medium-induced radiative energy loss decreases proportional to L^3. Medium-induced gluon production dominates only above a finite critical length which varies between 3 and more than 6 fm depending on the rescattering properties of the medium. Deviations from the BDMPS-L^2-behaviour persist above the critical length. The medium dependence of the angular gluon distribution is dominated by Brownian transverse momentum broadening. This results in a depletion of the low transverse momentum part of both the hard and the medium-induced contribution. As a consequence, the medium-induced energy loss outside a finite angular cone size can be more than a factor two larger than the total medium-induced radiative energy loss. We discuss implications of these results for the jet quenching signal in relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.","created":"2000-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Bx"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Mh"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"24.85.+p"},{"source":"author","value":"Radiative energy loss"},{"source":"author","value":"QCD dipole cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: quenching"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: enhancement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: multiple scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy loss"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: dipole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section: x-dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: path length"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":30,"citation_count":199,"authors":["Wiedemann, Urs Achim"]}

{"title":"Comment on `Neutrino oscillations in the early universe: How can large lepton asymmetry be generated?'","abstract":"We comment on the recent paper by A. D. Dolgov, S. H. Hansen, S. Pastor and D. V. Semikoz (DHPS) [Astropart. Phys. {\\bf 14}, 79 (2000)] on the generation of neutrino asymmetries from active-sterile neutrino oscillations. We demonstrate that the approximate asymmetry evolution equation obtained therein is an expansion, up to a minor discrepancy, of the well-established static approximation equation, valid only when the supposedly new higher order correction term is small. In the regime where this so-called ``back-reaction'' term is large and artificially terminates the asymmetry growth, their evolution equation ceases to be a faithful approximation to the Quantum Kinetic Equations (QKEs) simply because pure Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) transitions have been neglected. At low temperatures the MSW effect is the dominant asymmetry amplifier. Neither the static nor the DHPS approach contains this important physics. Therefore we conclude that the DHPS results have sufficient veracity at the onset of explosive asymmetry generation, but are invalid in the ensuing low temperature epoch where MSW conversions are able to enhance the asymmetry to values of order $0.2 - 0.37$. DHPS do claim to find a significant final asymmetry for very large $\\delta m^2$ values. However, for this regime the effective potential they employed is not valid.","created":"2000-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":32,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"resonance: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: back reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"MSW effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":29,"citation_count":30,"authors":["Di Bari, P.","Foot, Robert","Volkas, R.R.","Wong, Y.Y.Y."]}

Such a particularly simple form of the renormalizable superpotential may be enforced by discrete $R$-symmetries which are extended to the gravity-induced non-renormalizable operators as well. We show explicitly that within the supergravity-mediated supersymmetry-breaking scenario, the potentially dangerous divergent tadpoles associated with the presence of the gauge singlet first appear at loop levels higher than 5 and therefore do not destabilize the gauge hierarchy. The model provides a natural explanation for the origin of the $\\mu$-term, without suffering from the visible axion or the cosmological domain-wall problem. Focusing on the Higgs sector of this minimal non-minimal supersymmetric standard model, we calculate its effective Higgs potential by integrating out the dominant quantum effects due to stop squarks. We then discuss the phenomenological implications of the Higgs scalars predicted by the theory for the present and future high-energy colliders.

This thesis introduces a selection for the measurement of the cross section of $WW$-fusion considering most of the possible background processes. As results, the measurement errors achievable for Higgs-masses 120 Ge V < $m_H$ < 160 GeV at ,$\\sqrt{s}$= 350 GeV and 500 GeV are given. The impact on the errors for determining the total decay width of these results is derived for the same set of parameters","created":"2000-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":90,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W W: fusion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs mechanism"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"linear collider: proposed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron --> Higgs particle neutrino/e DESY-KEYWORDS = 350-500 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":24,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Meyer, Niels T."]}

{"title":"From colored glass condensate to gluon plasma: Equilibration in high-energy heavy ion collisions","abstract":"The initial distribution of gluons at the very early times after a high energy heavy ion collision is described by the bulk scale $Q_s$ of gluon saturation in the nuclear wavefunction. The subsequent evolution of the system towards kinetic equilibrium is described by a non-linear Landau equation for the single particle distributions \\cite{Mueller1,Mueller2}. In this paper, we solve this equation numerically for the idealized initial conditions proposed by Mueller, and study the evolution of the system to equilibrium. We discuss the sensitivity of our results on the dynamical screening of collinear divergences. In a particular model of dynamical screening, the convergence to the hydrodynamic limit is seen to be rapid relative to hydrodynamic time scales. The equilibration time, the initial temperature, and the chemical potential are shown to have a strong functional dependence on the initial gluon saturation scale $Q_s$.","created":"2000-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":34,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color glass condensate"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transport theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential equations: integral equations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: screening"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Fokker-Planck equation: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Boltzmann equation: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hydrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"entropy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: chemical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":55,"citation_count":99,"authors":["Bjoraker, Jefferson","Venugopalan, Raju"]}

{"title":"Low-energy solar neutrino detection by using liquid xenon","abstract":"Possibility to use ultra pure liquid Xenon as a low energy solar neutrino detector by means of $\\nu$+e scatterings is evaluated. A possible detector with 10 tons of fiducial volume will give $\\sim$14 events for pp-neutrinos and $\\sim$6 events for $^{7}$Be neutrinos with the energy threshold at 50 keV. The detector can be built with known and established technologies. High density of the liquid- Xe would provide self-shields against the incoming backgrounds originating from the container and outer environments. Internal backgrounds can be reduced by distillation and other techniques. Purification of the liquid Xe can be done continuously throughout the experiment. The spallation backgrounds are estimated to be small though an experimental determination is neccessary. The liquid-Xe detector can also provide a significantly better sensitivity for the double beta decay and a dark matter search. However the 2$\\nu$ double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe would be most background. It could be overcome if the 2$\\nu$ lifetime is longer than 10$^{22}$yr. However, an isotope separation of $^{136}$Xe is inevitable for a shorter lifetime. The isotope separations would, intoroduce a new opportunity to definitively identify dark matter.

{"title":"About the structure of the Froissart limit in QCD","abstract":"The Froissart asymptotic behavior of cross-sections is usually considered in a parton picture as corresponding to the collision of two almost black disks filled with partons. In this article we mainly concentrate on the examination of the local transparency of such F-disks. We discuss how is it possible to guarantee the boost-invariance of the reciprocal transparency of two such F-disks in a process of their collision, despite the fact that the mean area of the overlapping of these F-disks at the same impact parameter is varying with the Lorentz frame. We argue that on will always have such problems, if the dominant interactions at all energies remain soft, but such a trouble can be probably avoided if the mean parton virtualities grow with energies. This last is natural in QCD, and we use the qualitative generalization of BFKL approach to estimate the distribution of hard partons with various virtualities inside a F-disk. As a result, the quasiclassical partonic wave function corresponding to the F-limit can be approximately represented by the system of enclosed parton-gluon disks with a growing virtuality and blackness. With the increase of energy the new disks with larger virtualities are created in the middle of the previous disks, and then they expand with the same transverse velocity.","created":"2000-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"total cross section: high energy behavior"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Froissart bound"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unitarity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"invariance: Lorentz"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"particle: Regge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Regge poles"}],"num_refs":31,"citation_count":8,"authors":["Kancheli, O.V."]}

For the polarization of J/psi in DIS processes, we find the parameter alpha changes with Q^2. Especially, at higher Q^2, difference on alpha between color-singlet and color-octet contributions become more distinctive. In the two regions of lower and larger z, the polarization parameter alpha have different features.

{"title":"Domain walls in QCD","abstract":"QCD was shown to have a nontrivial vacuum structure due to the topology of the theta = theta+2*pi*n parameter. As a result of this nontrivial topology, in the large N_c limit, quasi-stable QCD domain walls appear, characterized by a transition in the singlet eta' field. We discuss the physics of these QCD domain walls as well as related axion domain walls and we present a new type of axion wall which also contains an eta' transition. We argue that these domain walls are topologically stable in the limit N_c->infinity and classically stable for large but finite N_c, however, they can decay through a tunneling process. We argue that the qualitative features of these QCD domain walls -- namely their classical stability -- persist to the realistic case of N_c=3 and that it is at least possible that their lifetime could be macroscopically large. If it is, then QCD domain walls could play an important role in the evolution of early universe and may be detectable in energetic collisions such as those at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).","created":"2000-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: domain wall"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"domain wall: axion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dependence: Theta parameter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N: color"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: topological"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"domain wall: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"domain wall: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string tension"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tunneling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":58,"citation_count":39,"authors":["Forbes, Michael McNeil","Zhitnitsky, Ariel R."]}

The method is implemented successfully in both spherically symmetric and axisymmetric codes. New resonant oscillon solutions are discussed and the threshold of expanding bubble formation is explored in both spherical and axial symmetry. Approximate resonant oscillon solutions are obtained using trial function methods and variational principles that are consistent with dynamical evolutions.","created":"2000-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":132,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Klein-Gordon equation: nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: bubble"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bubble: oscillon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"resonance: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential equations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bubble: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"threshold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time: scaling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical methods"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":43,"citation_count":5,"authors":["Honda, Ethan Philip"]}

In contrast to its further simplifications (like, for instance, the so-called reduced Salpeter equation), it allows also the consideration of bound states composed of \"light\" constituents. Every eigenvalue equation with solutions in some linear space may be (approximately) solved by conversion into an equivalent matrix eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate that the matrices arising in these representations of the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation may be found, at least for a wide class of interactions, in an entirely algebraic manner. The advantages of having the involved matrices explicitly, i.e., not \"contaminated\" by errors induced by numerical computations, at one's disposal are obvious: problems like, for instance, questions of the stability of eigenvalues may be analyzed more rigorously; furthermore, for small matrix sizes the eigenvalues may even be calculated analytically.","created":"2000-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":21,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Bethe-Salpeter equation: approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Bethe-Salpeter equation: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bound state: pseudoscalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bound state: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":21,"citation_count":17,"authors":["Lucha, Wolfgang","Maung, Khin Maung","Schoberl, Franz F."]}

{"title":"A Solution to the mu problem in the presence of a heavy gluino LSP","abstract":"In this paper we present a solution to the $\\mu$ problem in an SO(10) supersymmetric grand unified model with gauge mediated and D-term supersymmetry breaking. A Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken at the messenger scale $M\\sim 10^{12}$ GeV and enables the generation of the $\\mu$ term. The boundary conditions defined at $M$ lead to a phenomenologically acceptable version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with novel particle phenomenology. Either the gluino or the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). If the gravitino is the LSP, then the gluino is the next-to-LSP (NLSP) with a lifetime on the order of one month or longer. In either case this heavy gluino, with mass in the range 25 - 35 GeV, can be treated as a stable particle with respect to experiments at high energy accelerators. Given the extensive phenomenological constraints we show that the model can only survive in a narrow region of parameter space resulting in a light neutral Higgs with mass $\\sim 86 - 91$ GeV and $\\tan\\beta \\sim 9 - 14$. In addition the lightest stop and neutralino have mass $\\sim 100 - 122$ GeV and $\\sim 50 - 72$ GeV, respectively. Thus the model will soon be tested.

In the situation of self-tuning branes (corresponding to an exponential potential) where the bulk cosmological constant is set to zero, the brane tensions have hierarchical values.","created":"2000-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":3,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Columbus 2000/08/09"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model: tension"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Randall-Sundrum model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hierarchy: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radion: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Friedman model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"}],"num_refs":6,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Marfatia, Danny"]}
{"title":"Techniques for the top squark search at the Fermilab Tevatron","abstract":"This dissertation addresses the question of how to detect light top squarks at the upgraded Fermilab Tevatron collider. After a brief introduction to supersymmetry, the basic phenomenology of the light stop is reviewed and the current experimental situation is surveyed. The analysis presented here is based on collider event simulations. The main decay modes accessible to the Tevatron are studied, feasible discovery channels are identified, and recipes for experimental analysis are proposed. It is found that stops with masses up to the top quark mass are liable to detection under these schemes with the data from a few years' running at the upgraded Tevatron. With such an extended run, significant portions of parameter space may be probed.","created":"2000-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":110,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"new particle: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"stop"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: particle identification"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charm"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Wino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Zino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"final state: ((n)jet missing-energy)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"final state: (beauty lepton)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"final state: dilepton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Batavia TEVATRON Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p --> squark anything"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark --> charm Zino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark --> beauty Wino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"1800: 2000 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":71,"citation_count":5,"authors":["Sender, John"]}

The essential physical input is to question the textbook wisdom, ``Now when a particle is at rest, one cannot define its spin as either left- or right-handed, so phi_R(0) = phi_L(0),'' as found, e.g., in Lewis Ryder's Quantum Field Theory, and in many other books on the representations of the Lorentz group. It is suggested that this equality is true only up to a phase. The demand of C, P, and T covariances, separately, fixes this phase to be pm 1. If these conditions are relaxed, a natural CP-violating kinematic structure emerges. Having established a CP-violating kinematic structure, we then discuss how Planck scale physics necessarily invokes non-commutative space-time and that such changes in the structure of space-time will force upon us additional violations/deformations of the CPT structure of space-time, and a violation of the principle of equivalence via a violation of the Lorentz symmetries. The latter may carry significant consequences for understanding the data on ultra high energy cosmic rays.","created":"2000-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"CP invariance"},{"source":"author","value":"C invariance"},{"source":"author","value":"P invariance"},{"source":"author","value":"T invariance"},{"source":"author","value":"kinematics"},{"source":"author","value":"quantum field theory"},{"source":"author","value":"space-time configurations"},{"source":"author","value":"gravity"},{"source":"author","value":"cosmic rays"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Metepec 2000/08/09"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"kinematics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: noncommutative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"violation: Lorentz"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"equivalence principle: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"invariance: CPT"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation: effect"}],"num_refs":30,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Ahluwalia, Dharam Vir"]}

This contribution only requires moderate mass splitting between the right-handed squarks u(tilde)_R and d(tilde)_R, and persists for squark masses of order 1 TeV.

{"title":"How can one understand the lightest scalars, especially the sigma?","abstract":"We discuss how the a_0(980), f_0(980), K^*_0(1430) and particularly the broad sigma resonance can be understood within a coupled channel framework, which includes all light two-pseudoscalar thresholds together with constraints from Adler zeroes, flavour symmetric couplings, unitarity and physically acceptable analyticity. All (qbar q) scalars are, when unitarized, strongly distorted by hadronic mass shifts, and the nonstrange isoscalar state becomes a very broad resonance, with its pole at 470-i250 MeV. We believe this is the sigma meson required by models for spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Recently this light resonance has clearly been observed in D-> sigma pi-> 3pi by the E791 experiment at Fermilab, and we discuss how this decay channel can be predicted in a Constituent Quark Meson Model (CQM), which incorporates heavy quark and chiral symmetries. We also discuss the less well known phenomenon that with a large coupling there can appear two physical resonance poles on the second sheet although only one bare quark-antiquark state is put in. The f_0(980) and f_0(1370) resonance poles can thus be two manifestations of the same (sbar s) quark state. Both of these states are seen clearly in D_s-> 3pi by the E791 experiment, where (sbar s) intermediate states are expected to be dominant.","created":"2000-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":9,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Venice 2000/08/20"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: hadron spectroscopy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar meson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"f0(600)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partial wave analysis: coupled channel"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"final state: (3pi)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"f0(980)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"f0(1370)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Jona-Lasinio-Nambu model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sigma model: linear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: unitarity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D --> 3pi"}],"num_refs":20,"citation_count":21,"authors":["Tornqvist, N.A.","Polosa, A.D."]}

This theory has no fermion sign problem and can be simulated on the lattice using present-day techniques. We solve this theory analytically in two limits: low mu_I where chiral perturbation theory is applicable, and asymptotically high mu_I where perturbative QCD is at work. At low isospin density the ground state is a superfluid pion condensate. At very high density it is a Fermi liquid with Cooper pairing. The pairs carry the same quantum numbers as the pions. Motivated by this observation, we put forward a conjecture that the transition from hadron to quark matter is smooth. The conjecture passes several nontrivial tests. Our results imply a nontrivial phase diagram in the space of temperature and chemical potentials of isospin and baryon number. At asymtotically large values of mu_I and small values of baryon chemical potential the ground state is in a phase similar to Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase. It is characterized by a spatially modulated superfluid order parameter <ubar*gamma_5*d> and may be the asymptotic limit of the inhomogeneous pion condensation phase advocated by Migdal and others.","created":"2000-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"isospin: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density: finite"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: chemical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"ground state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: superfluid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transition: quark hadron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark antiquark: condensation"}],"num_refs":40,"citation_count":195,"authors":["Son, D.T.","Stephanov, Misha A."]}

{"title":"Simulations of R-parity Violating SUSY Models","abstract":"In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in R-parity violating super-\nsymmetric models. We explain the motivation for studying these models and explore the\nvarious phenomenological consequences of R-parity violation. In particular, we argue that\nif we are to explore all channels for the discovery of supersymmetry then these models\nmust be investigated.\nIt has become essential for the experimental study of any new model to have a Monte\nCarlo event generator which includes the processes predicted by that model. We review the\ntechniques used in the construction of these simulations and show how we have extended\nthe HERWIG event generator to include R-parity violating processes. We discuss how to\ntreat the emission of QCD radiation in these processes including colour coherence effects\nvia the angular-ordered parton shower.\nWe then make use of this simulation to investigate the discovery potential for resonant\nslepton production, via either supersymmetric gauge or R-parity violating decay modes,\nin hadron���hadron collisions. In particular, we show that although the colour coherence\nproperties of the R-parity violating decay modes can be used to improve the extraction of\na signal above the QCD background these processes will only be visible for large values\nof the R-parity violating Yukawa couplings. However a signal, i.e. like-sign dilepton\nproduction, from the supersymmetric gauge decay modes is visible above the background\nfor much smaller values of the R-parity violating Yukawa couplings.\nFinally, we look at the possibility that the KARMEN time anomaly can be explained\nby the existence of a light neutralino which is produced in the decay of charged pions via\nR-parity violation. This neutralino then decays inside the KARMEN detector, into three\nleptons via R-parity violation, explaining the excess of events observed by the KARMEN\nexperiment.","created":"2001-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":225,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiation: emission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: coherence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"showers: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"slepton: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"slepton: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":200,"citation_count":29,"authors":["Richardson, Peter"]}

In supersymmetric theories with gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking, the fundamental small parameter is not v/M_{Pl}, but m_I/M_{Pl}, where m_I is the scale of supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector. We note that m_I^3/M_{Pl}^2 is only slightly too large to explain SuperKamiokande, and present two models that achieve neutrino masses at this order in m_I, one of which has an additional suppression lambda_tau^2, while the other has additional suppression arising from a loop factor.

This problem is of phenomenological interest because the values 2 M_W and 2 M_Z, corresponding to the W- and Z-boson thresholds, lie within the M range presently favoured by electroweak precision data. We demonstrate how these threshold singularities are eliminated when the definitions of mass and total decay width of the Higgs boson are based on the complex-valued pole of its propagator. We illustrate the phenomenological implications of this modification for the partial width of the H -> W^+ W^- decay.","created":"2000-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.15.Bt"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.15.Lk"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.80.Bn"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"threshold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"analytic properties"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":38,"citation_count":24,"authors":["Kniehl, Bernd A.","Palisoc, Caesar P.","Sirlin, Alberto"]}

These nonperturbative corrections can be resummed and factor out into a universal nonperturbative distribution, the shape function, and the differential event shape distributions are given by convolution of the shape function with perturbative cross-sections. Choosing a simple ansatz for the shape function we demonstrate a good agreement of the obtained QCD predictions for the distributions and their lowest moments with the existing data over a wide energy interval.","created":"2000-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"event shape analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: thrust"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"factorization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":136,"authors":["Korchemsky, G.P.","Tafat, S."]}

As a result, quantization leads to a set of naturally defined state parameters which are the number densities of particles and anti-particles trapped in the cosmic string.

{"title":"Low scale seesaw mechanisms for light neutrinos","abstract":"Alternatives to the see-saw mechanism are explored in supersymmetric models with three right-handed or sterile neutrinos. Tree-level Yukawa couplings can be drastically suppressed in a natural way to give sub-eV Dirac neutrino masses. If, in addition, a B-L gauge symmetry broken at a large scale M_G is introduced, a wider range of possibilities opens up. The value of the right-handed neutrino mass M_R can be easily disentangled from that of M_G. Dirac and Majorana neutrino masses at the eV scale can be generated radiatively through the exchange of sneutrinos and neutralinos. Dirac masses m_D owe their smallness to the pattern of light-heavy scales in the neutralino mass matrix. The smallness of the Majorana masses m_L is linked to a similar see-saw pattern in the sneutrino mass matrix. Two distinct scenarios emerge. In the first, with very small or vanishing M_R, the physical neutrino eigenstates are, for each generation, either two light Majorana states with mixing angle ranging from very small to maximal, depending on the ratio m_D/M_R, or one light Dirac state. In the second scenario, with a large value of M_R, the physical eigenstates are two nearly unmixed Majorana states with masses \\sim m_L and \\sim M_R. In both cases, the (B-L)-breaking scale M_G is, in general, much smaller than that in the traditional see-saw mechanism.","created":"2000-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B-L number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Dirac"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass generation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sneutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":89,"citation_count":132,"authors":["Borzumati, Francesca","Nomura, Yasunori"]}

{"title":"Baryonic resonances mass spectrum from a modified perturbative QCD","abstract":"A recently proposed modified perturbation expansion for QCD incorporating gluon condensation effects is employed to evaluate the quark self-energy in the simplest approximation. One of the solutions of the modified mass shell predicts mass values which increases monotonically with the corresponding Lagrangian mass for each kind of flavour. The mass spectrum of the ground states within the various groups of hadronic resonances and a class of mesonic ones is well predicted by the simple addition of the calculated constituent quark masses. These results suggest the gluon condensate nature of many baryonic resonances and the possibility of their description by a modified perturbative theory. Finally, it is conjectured that this procedure, after also introducing quark condensates in a same token as the gluonic ones, could predict the Lagrangian quark masses as well as the non-colored fermion (leptons and neutrinos) mass spectrum, through higher order radiative correction. Such a picture, if verified, would furnish a natural explanation of the mass spectrum of the three generations of fundamental fermions.","created":"2000-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator: renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon resonance: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":11,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Cabo Montes de Oca, Alejandro","Rigol, Marcos"]}

This gives the model an approximate or exact Z$_2$ symmetry whose breaking leads to domain walls. The simplest domain wall has the structure of a kink across which the Higgs field changes sign ($\\Phi \\to -\\Phi$) and inside which the full SU(5) is restored. The kink is shown to be perturbatively unstable for all parameters. We then construct a domain wall solution that is lighter than the kink and show it to be perturbatively stable for a range of parameters. The symmetry in the core of this domain wall is smaller than that outside. The interactions of the domain wall with magnetic monopole is discussed and it is shown that magnetic monopoles with certain internal space orientations relative to the wall pass through the domain wall. Magnetic monopoles in other relative internal space orientations are likely to be swept away on collision with the domain walls, suggesting a scenario where the domain walls might act like optical polarization filters, allowing certain monopole ``polarizations'' to pass through but not others. As SU(5) domain walls will also be formed at small values of the cubic coupling, this leads to a very complicated picture of the evolution of defects after the Grand Unified phase transition.","created":"2000-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":6,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SU(5)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"domain wall"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking: Z(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"kink"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnetic monopole: interaction"}],"num_refs":6,"citation_count":36,"authors":["Pogosian, Levon","Vachaspati, Tanmay"]}

These corrections are finite only for d=1; for d\\ge 2 the infinite tower of KK modes gives a divergent contribution that has to be regularized introducing a cutoff (the string scale). However, the ultraviolet dependence of the KK effects is completely different if the running of the couplings with the scale is taken into account. We find that for larger d the number of excitations at each KK level increases, but their larger number is compensated by the smaller value of the gauge coupling at that scale. As a result, for any number of extra dimensions the exchange of the complete KK tower always gives a finite contribution. We show that (i) for d=1 the running of the gauge coupling decreases an 14% the effect of the KK modes on electroweak observables; (ii) in all cases more than 90% of the total effect comes from the excitations in the seven lowest KK levels and is then independent of ultraviolet physics.","created":"2000-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization: dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tree approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":15,"citation_count":12,"authors":["Masip, M."]}

{"title":"Universal unitarity triangle and physics beyond the standard model","abstract":"We make the simple observation that there exists a universal unitarity triangle for all models, like the SM, the Two Higgs Doublet Models I and II and the MSSM with minimal flavour violation, that do not have any new operators beyond those present in the SM and in which all flavour changing transitions are governed by the CKM matrix with no new phases beyond the CKM phase. This universal triangle can be determined in the near future from the ratio (Delta M)_d/(Delta M)_s and sin(2 beta) measured first through the CP asymmetry in B_d^0 to psi K_S and later in K to pi nu nubar decays. Also suitable ratios of the branching ratios for B to X_{d,s} nu nubar and B_{d,s} to mu^+ mu^- and the angle gamma measured by means of CP asymmetries in B decays can be used for this determination. Comparison of this universal triangle with the non-universal triangles extracted in each model using epsilon, (Delta M)_d and various branching ratios for rare decays will allow to find out in a transparent manner which of these models, if any, is singled out by experiment. A virtue of the universal triangle is that it allows to separate the determination of the CKM parameters from the determination of new parameters present in the extensions of the SM considered here.","created":"2000-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":11,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CKM matrix: unitarity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"doublet: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B0: mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":43,"citation_count":604,"authors":["Buras, A.J.","Gambino, P.","Gorbahn, M.","Jager, S.","Silvestrini, L."]}

We thoroughly examine these and show that, if the variables of the effective theory are chosen suitably, the known large N_c counting rules of QCD can unambiguously be translated into corresponding counting rules for the effective coupling constants. As an application, we demonstrate that the Kaplan-Manohar transformation is in conflict with these rules and is suppressed to all orders in 1/N_c. The anomalous dimension of the axial singlet current generates an additional complication: The corresponding external field undergoes nonmultiplicative renormalization. As a consequence, the Wess-Zumino-Witten term, which accounts for the U(3)_R x U(3)_L anomalies in the framework of the effective theory, contains pieces that depend on the running scale of QCD.

Universality of the soft supersymmetry-breaking scalar masses for the Higgs multiplets is not assumed, but the MSSM parameters are nevertheless required to lead consistently to an electroweak vacuum. We explore systematically the region of MSSM parameter space where LEP and other accelerator constraints are respected, and the relic neutralino density lies in the range 0.1 < Omega_chi h^2 < 0.3 preferred by cosmology. We also discuss models with Omega_chi h^2 < 0.1, in which case we scale the density of supersymmetric dark matter in our galactic halo by Omega_chi h^2 / 0.1, allowing for the possible existence of some complementary form of cold dark matter. We find values of the cross sections that are considerably lower than the present experimental sensitivities. At low neutralino masses, m_chi < 100 GeV, the cross sections may be somewhat higher than in the constrained MSSM with universal soft Higgs masses, though they are generally lower.

{"title":"Quark - anti-quark bound states and the Breit equation","abstract":"A non-covariant but approximately relativistic two-body wave equation (Breit equation) describing the quantum mechanics of two fermions interacting with one another through a potential containing scalar, pseudoscalar and vector parts is presented. After expressing the sixteen component two-body wavefunction in terms of a radial and an angular function by means of the multipole expansion, the initial equation can be reduced into a set of sixteen radial equations which, in turn, can be classified in accordance to the parity and the state of the wavefunctions involved. The adequacy of the reduced equations in describing real problems is discussed by applying the theory to QCD problems and the calculation of the energies of bound states of quark-antiquark systems is performed to order $\\alpha^4$.

{"title":"Renormalons and multiloop estimates in scalar correlators: Higgs decay and quark mass sum rules","abstract":"The single renormalon-chain contribution to the correlator of scalar currents in QCD is calculated in the MS -scheme in the limit of a large number of fermions, N f . At n -loop order we find that in the MS -scheme the factorial growth of the perturbative coefficients due to renormalons takes over almost immediately in the Euclidean region. The essential differences between the large-order growth of perturbative coefficients in the present scalar case, and in the previously-studied vector case are analysed. In the timelike region a stabilization of the corresponding perturbative series for the imaginary part, with n -loop behaviour S n /[ log (s/�� 2 )] n���1 , where S n is essentially constant for n���6 , is observed. Only for n���7 does one discern the factorial growth and alternations of sign. We use the new all-orders results to scrutinize the performance of multi-loop estimates, using a large- �� 0 =(11N c ���2N f )/12 approximation, the so-called ���naive nonabelianization��� procedure, and within the effective charges approach. The asymptotic behaviour of perturbative coefficients, in both large- N f and large- N c limits, is analysed both in the spacelike and timelike regions. A contour-improved resummation technique in the timelike region is developed. Some subtleties connected with scheme-dependence are analysed, and illustrated using results in the MS - and V -schemes. The all-orders series under investigation are summed up with the help of the Borel resummation method.

Although supersymmetry is not a requirement of this scenario, it is nevertheless true that its best-motivated realizations arise in supersymmetric theories (like M theory). We argue here that supersymmetry can have robust, and in some instances fatal, implications for the expected experimental signature for TeV-scale gravity. The signature of the supersymmetric version of the scenario differs most dramatically from what has been considered in the literature because mass splittings within the gravity supermultiplet in these models are extremely small, implying in particular the existence of a very light spin-one superpartner for the graviton. We compute the implications of this graviphoton, and show that it can acquire dimension-four couplings to ordinary matter which can strongly conflict with supernova bounds.","created":"2000-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":30,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum gravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: space-time"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"graviphoton: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"graviphoton: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion antifermion: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supernova"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron --> graviphoton photon"}],"num_refs":51,"citation_count":47,"authors":["Atwood, D.","Burgess, C.P.","Filotas, E.","Leblond, F.","London, David","Maksymyk, I."]}

{"title":"Parton based Gribov-Regge theory","abstract":"We present a new parton model approach for hadron-hadron interactions and, in particular, for the initial stage of nuclear collisions at very high energies (RHIC, LHC and beyond). The most important aspect of our approach is a self-consistent treatment, using the same formalism for calculating cross sections and particle production, based on an effective, QCD-inspired field theory, where many of the inconsistencies of presently used models will be avoided. In addition, we provide a unified treatment of soft and hard scattering, such that there is no fundamental cutoff parameter any more defining an artificial border between soft and hard scattering. Our approach cures some of the main deficiencies of two of the standard procedures currently used: the Gribov-Regge theory and the eikonalized parton model. There, cross section calculations and particle production cannot be treated in a consistent way using a common formalism. In particular, energy conservation is taken care of in case of particle production, but not concerning cross section calculations. In addition, hard contributions depend crucially on some cutoff, being divergent for the cutoff being zero. Finally, in case of several elementary scatterings, they are not treated on the same level: the first collision is always treated differently than the subsequent ones. All these problems are solved in our new approach.","created":"2000-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":213,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus nucleus: nuclear reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"diffraction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unitarity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"statistics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pomeron: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: eikonal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pomeron: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: cascade"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: hadronization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model: hadronization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charged particle: multiple production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon p: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p nucleus: nuclear reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":52,"citation_count":444,"authors":["Drescher, H.J.","Hladik, M.","Ostapchenko, S.","Pierog, T.","Werner, K."]}

{"title":"Back reaction and the parametric resonance of cosmological fluctuations","abstract":"We study the class of two-field inflationary Universe models \\lambda\\phi^4/4 + g^2\\chi^2\\phi^2/2, in which parametric resonance during the initial stages of reheating can lead to an exponential amplification of the amplitude of cosmological fluctuations. Employing both analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we determine the time at which backreaction of fluctuations on the background fields shuts off the exponential growth, making use of the Hartree approximation, and including scalar metric perturbations. For the case g^2/\\lambda=2, we find that the amplitude of fluctuations after preheating will exceed the observational upper bound independent of the value of \\lambda, unless the duration of inflation is very long. Cosmological fluctuations are acceptably small for g^2/\\lambda>=8.

A discussion of baryon transfers in heavy ion scattering follows. It shortly reviews existing string model concepts, which were found to be consistent with the data.

From the color structure the baryonium can be identified with an Odderon exchange. We conjecture that the two Odderon cuts occur with an opposite sign and partially cancel. As the Odderon is predicted to have a rather high trajectory it has to involve small coupling constants.

The stringent experimental constraints on the CP-violating phases from the electron and neutron electric dipole moments are included in the analysis for two exemplary scenarios of the SUSY parameters; one with decoupled first two generation sfermions and the other with non-decoupled sfermions. In both scenarios, the production cross section and the branching fractions of the leptonic chargino and neutralino decays are sensitive to CP-violating phases. The production-decay spin correlations lead to several non-trivial CP-even observables such as the lepton invariant mass distribution and the lepton angular distribution, and several interesting T-odd (CP-odd) momentum triple products.

We also comment on the possibility of using hadronically-decaying taus to improve the limits.","created":"2000-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":23,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z'"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"weak interaction: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(2) x SU(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dynamical symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: composite"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z': mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z': leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z': width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: multiple production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"multiplicity: jet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular distribution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"luminosity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum: (muon electron)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CERN LEP Stor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Batavia TEVATRON Coll"}],"num_refs":39,"citation_count":97,"authors":["Lynch, Kevin R.","Simmons, Elizabeth H.","Narain, Meenakshi","Mrenna, Stephen"]}

{"title":"Scenario for ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. 2. Geometry of quantum states at the earliest stage","abstract":"We suggest that the ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy ions provide the simplest situation for the study of strong interactions which can be understood from first principles and without any model assumptions about the microscopic structure of the colliding nuclei. We argue that the boost-invariant geometry of the collision, and the existence of hard partons in the final states, both supported by the data, make a sufficient basis for the quantum theory of the phenomenon. We conclude that the quantum nature of the entire process is defined by its global geometry, which is enforced by a macroscopic finite size of the colliding objects. In this paper, we study the qualitative aspects of the theory and review its development in two subsequent papers. Our key result is that the effective mass of the quark in the expanding system formed in the collision of the two nuclei is gradually built up reaching its maximum by the time the quark mode becomes sufficiently localized. The chromo-magneto-static interaction of the color currents flowing in the rapidity direction is the main mechanism which is responsible for the generation of the effective mass of the soft quark mode and therefore, for the physical scale at the earliest stage of the collision.","created":"2000-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":23,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus nucleus: nuclear reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear reaction: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"geometry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum mechanics: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: correlation function"}],"num_refs":10,"citation_count":9,"authors":["Makhlin, A."]}
