{"title":"Unusual bound states of quark matter within the NJL model","abstract":"Properties of dense quark matter in and out of chemical equilibrium are studied within the SU(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. In addition to the 4-fermion scalar and vector terms the model includes also the 6-fermion flavour mixing interaction. First we study a novel form of deconfined matter, meso-matter, which is composed of equal number of quarks and antiquarks. It can be thought of as a strongly compressed meson gas where mesons are melted into their elementary constituents, quarks and antiquarks. Strongly bound states in this quark-antiquark matter are predicted for all flavour combinations of quark-antiquark pairs. The maximum binding energy reaches up to 180 MeV per pair for mixtures with about 70% of strange quark-antiquark pairs. Equilibrated baryon-rich quark matter with various flavour compositions is also studied. In this case only shallow bound states appear in systems with a significant admixture (about 40%) of strange quarks (strangelets). Their binding energies are quite sensitive to the relative strengths of scalar and vector interactions. The common property of all these bound states is that they appear at high particle densities when the chiral symmetry is nearly restored. Thermal properties of meso-matter as well as chemically equilibrated strange quark matter are also investigated. Possible decay modes of these bound states are discussed.","created":"2000-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":27,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Jona-Lasinio-Nambu model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bound state: (quark antiquark)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: interference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"multiquark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mean field approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"binding energy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: strangeness"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bound state: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":45,"citation_count":37,"authors":["Mishustin, I.N.","Satarov, L.M.","Stoecker, Horst","Greiner, W."]}

Within MSSM the solar neutrino problem can be resolved either through vacuum oscillations or the large mixing angle MSW solution.

By including a non-renormalizable superpotential term, we generate an inflationary valley along which G_{PS} is broken to the standard model gauge group. Thus, catastrophic production of the doubly charged magnetic monopoles, which are predicted by the model, cannot occur at the end of inflation. The results of the cosmic background explorer can be reproduced with natural values (of order 10^{-3}) of the relevant coupling constant, and symmetry breaking scale of G_{PS} close to 10^{16} GeV. The spectral index of density perturbations lies between unity and 0.9. Moreover, the mu-term is generated via a Peccei-Quinn symmetry and proton is practically stable. Baryogenesis in the universe takes place via leptogenesis. The low deuterium abundance constraint on the baryon asymmetry, the gravitino limit on the reheat temperature and the requirement of almost maximal mu neutrino - tau neutrino mixing from SuperKamiokande can be simultaneously met with mu-neutrino, tau-neutrino and heaviest Dirac neutrino masses determined from the large angle MSW resolution of the solar neutrino problem, the SuperKamiokande results and SU(4)_c symmetry respectively.","created":"2000-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":27,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(4) x SU(2) x SU(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation: hybrid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnetic monopole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"deuterium: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mixing angle: (neutrino/mu neutrino/tau)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"MSW effect effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"KAMIOKANDE"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":41,"citation_count":173,"authors":["Jeannerot, R.","Khalil, S.","Lazarides, George","Shafi, Q."]}
{"title":"The Minimum width condition for neutrino conversion in matter","abstract":"We find that for small vacuum mixing angle $\\theta$ and low energies ($s\\ll M^2_Z$) the width of matter, $d_{1/2}$, needed to have conversion probability $P\\geq 1/2$ should be larger than $d_{min}= \\pi/(2\\sqrt{2} G_{F} \\tan 2 \\theta)$: $d_{1/2}\\geq d_{min}$. Here $G_F$ is the Fermi constant, $s$ is the total energy squared in the center of mass and $M_Z$ is the mass of the $Z$ boson. The absolute minimum $d_{1/2}=d_{min}$ is realized for oscillations in a uniform medium with resonance density. For all the other density distributions (monotonically varying density, castle wall profile, etc.) the required width $d_{1/2}$ is larger than $d_{min}$. The width $d_{min}$ depends on $s$, and for $Z$-resonance channels at $s\\sim M^2_Z$ we get that $d_{min}(s)$ is 20 times smaller than the low energy value. We apply the minimum width condition, $d\\geq d_{min}$, to high energy neutrinos in matter as well as in neutrino background. Using this condition, we conclude that the matter effect is negligible for neutrinos propagating in AGN and GRBs environments. Significant conversion can be expected for neutrinos crossing dark matter halos of clusters of galaxies and for neutrinos produced by cosmologically distant sources and propagating in the universe.","created":"2000-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":34,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.60.Pq"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.60.St"},{"source":"author","value":"Neutrinos"},{"source":"author","value":"Matter effects"},{"source":"author","value":"Universe"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"resonance: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interaction: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"AGN"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":37,"citation_count":45,"authors":["Lunardini, C.","Smirnov, A.Yu."]}

Our model for coherent meson electroproduction requires the assumption of mesonic currents and couplings which can be verified in separate experiments.

{"title":"The Proton spin puzzle: a status report","abstract":"The proton spin puzzle inspired by the EMC experiment and its present status are closely examined. Recent experimental progress is reviewed. Various factorization schemes due to the ambiguity arising from the axial anomaly are discussed. Some misconceptions in the literature about the $\\MS$ factorization scheme are clarified. It is stressed that the polarized nucleon structure function $g_1(x)$ is independent of the factorization scheme chosen in defining the quark spin density. Consequently, the anomalous gluon and sea-quark interpretations for the deviation of the observed first moment of $g_1^p(x)$ from the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule are equivalent. While it is well known that the total quark spin in the chiral-invariant (CI) factorization scheme (e.g. the improved parton model) can be made to be close to the quark model expectation provided that the gluon spin is positive and large enough, it is much less known that, contrary to the gauge-invariant scheme (e.g. the MSbar scheme), the quark orbital angular momentum in the CI scheme deviates even farther from the relativistic quark model prediction. Recent developments in the NLO analysis of polarized DIS data, orbital angular momentum and lattice calculations of the proton spin content are briefly sketched.","created":"2000-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Tainan 2000/01/31"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: spin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton nucleon: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"structure function: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: sea"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"factorization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sum rule"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":95,"citation_count":24,"authors":["Cheng, Hai-Yang"]}

In the scenario of large extra dimensions, proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali, graviscalar Kaluza-Klein excitations are less important than the spin-2 counterparts in most processes. However, there are important exceptions. The Higgs boson can mix to these particles by coupling to the Ricci scalar. Because of the large number of states involved, this mixing leads, in practice, to a sizeable invisible width for the Higgs. In the Randall-Sundrum scenario, the only graviscalar is the radion. It can be produced copiously at hadron colliders by virtue of its enhanced coupling to two gluons through the trace anomaly of QCD. We study both the production and decay of the radion, and compare it to the Standard Model Higgs boson.

We take a more conventional approach from one in Ref. 1 [Joyce, Prokopec] and assume that the Universe reheats by the scalar field decay before the nucleosynthesis epoch, and find a larger expansion rate at the electroweak scale than the one obtained in Ref. 1. The decaying field models suffer however from an entropy release that dilutes the baryon number produced at the electroweak scale. This dilution is minimized when the kinetic scalar field mode dominates (w_phi = 1), singling it out as the preferred cosmology with regard to baryogenesis. We study both cases, the electroweak transition with an expansion driven departure from equilibrium, and a first order phase transition. We show that in the former case with some tuning one can produce the amount of matter consistent with observation. In the latter case the expansion rate at the electroweak scale may be almost as large as the symmetric phase sphaleron rate, so that even the electroweak models with a relatively weak first order phase transition can be viable for baryogenesis.","created":"2000-02-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":11,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sphaleron"}],"num_refs":13,"citation_count":7,"authors":["Prokopec, Tomislav"]}

The first study deals with the characteristics of the light Higgs boson spectrum allowed by the (minimal and non-minimal) GMSB framework. Today's most accurate GMSB model generation and two-loop Feynman-diagrammatic calculation of m_h have been combined. The Higgs masses are shown in dependence of various model parameters at the messenger and electroweak scales. In the minimal model, an upper limit on m_h of about 124 GeV is found for m_t = 175 GeV. The second study is focused on the measurement of the fundamental SUSY breaking scale sqrt(F) at the LHC in the GMSB scenario where a stau is the next-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP) and decays into a gravitino with c*tau_NLSP in the range 0.5 m to 1 km.

{"title":"Energy loss in perturbative QCD","abstract":"We review the properties of energetic parton propagation in hot or cold QCD matter, as obtained in recent works. Advances in understanding the energy loss - collisional and radiative - are summarized, with emphasis on the latter: it features very interesting properties which may help to detect the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions. We describe two different theoretical approaches, which lead to the same radiated gluon energy spectrum. The case of a longitudinally expanding QCD plasma is investigated. The energy lost by a jet with given opening angle is calculated in view of making predictions for the suppression (quenching) of hard jet production. Phenomenological implications for the difference between hot and cold matter are discussed. Numerical estimates of the loss suggest that it may be significantly enhanced in hot compared to cold matter.","created":"2000-02-21T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":48,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parton: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy loss"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: transverse momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: jet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"path integral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":75,"citation_count":722,"authors":["Baier, R.","Schiff, D.","Zakharov, B.G."]}

Assuming a ``phenomenological'' stabilization mechanism, that creates a non-vanishing $\\hat T^5_5$ in the bulk, we construct a two-brane model, which allows both branes to have positive self-energies. We then consider a candidate theory for the dynamical stabilization, through the introduction of a massless scalar field in the bulk, which interacts with the branes. We find exact static solutions for the metric and scalar field in the bulk and demonstrate that the inter-brane distance is determined by the parameters of scalar field-brane interactions. However, these solutions are always accompanied by a correlation between the bulk cosmological constant, the brane self-energies and the interaction terms of the scalar field with the branes and thus cannot be considered as candidates for the phenomenologically viable stabilized geometry. We find that the aforementioned correlation cannot be avoided even in the case of a single-brane solution with positive self-energy where the fifth dimension ends on a singularity.","created":"2000-02-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":16,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"98.80.Cq"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"04.50.+h"},{"source":"author","value":"Brane cosmology"},{"source":"author","value":"Scalar fields"},{"source":"author","value":"Stabilization of extra dimension"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Einstein equation: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"massless"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator: renormalization"}],"num_refs":38,"citation_count":98,"authors":["Kanti, Panagiota","Olive, Keith A.","Pospelov, Maxim"]}

Using normal distributions for the experimental input data we find Re eps'/eps = (2.2 \\pm 0.8) x 10^{-3}, whereas a flat scanning gives 0.9 x 10^{-3} < Re eps'/eps < 4.8 x 10^{-3}.

The key element in our estimate is, as before, the fit of the Delta I=1/2 rule, which allows us to absorb most of the theoretical uncertainties in the determination of the model-dependent parameters in the hadronic matrix elements. Our semi-phenomenological approach leads to numerical stability against variations of the renormalization scale and scheme dependence of the short- and long-distance components.

The full non-linear calculations for the dynamics of the complex scalar field are made. Since the scalar potential in this model is flatter than \\phi^2, we have found that fluctuations develop and go non-linear to form non-topological solitons, Q-balls. The size of a Q-ball is determined by the most amplified mode, which is completely determined by the model parameters. On the other hand, the charge of Q-balls depends linearly on the initial charge density of the Affleck-Dine (AD) field. Almost all the charges are absorbed into Q-balls, and only a tiny fraction of the charges is carried by a relic AD field. It may lead to some constraints on the baryogenesis and/or parameters in the particle theory. The peculiarity of gravity-mediation is the moving Q-balls. This results in collisions between Q-balls.

{"title":"Natural effective supersymmetry","abstract":"Much heavier sfermions of the first-two generations than the other superparticles provide a natural explanation for the flavor and CP problems in the supersymmetric standard model (SUSY SM). However, the heavy sfermions may drive the mass squareds for the light third generation sfermions to be negative through two-loop renormalization group (RG) equations, breaking color and charge. Introducing extra matters to the SUSY SM, it is possible to construct models where the sfermion masses are RG invariant at the two-loop level in the limit of vanishing gaugino-mass and Yukawa-coupling contributions. We calculate the finite corrections to the light sfermion masses at the two-loop level in the models. We find that the finite corrections to the light-squark mass squareds are negative and can be less than (0.3-1)% of the heavy-squark mass squareds, depending on the number and the parameters of the extra matters. We also discuss whether such models realized by the U(1)_X gauge interaction at the GUT scale can satisfy the constraints from \\Delta m_K and \\epsilon_K naturally. When both the left- and right-handed down-type squarks of the first-two generations have common U(1)_X charges, the supersymmetric contributions to \\Delta m_K and \\epsilon_K are sufficiently suppressed without spoiling naturalness, even if the flavor-violating supergravity contributions to the sfermion mass matrices are included. When only the right-handed squarks of the first-two generations have a common U(1)_X charge, we can still satisfy the constraint from \\Delta m_K naturally, but evading the bound from \\epsilon_K requires the CP phase smaller than 10^{-2}.","created":"2000-02-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":45,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.80.Ly"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.60.Jv"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.15.Ff"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sfermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SU(5)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K0 anti-K0: mixing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(N)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gaugino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":59,"citation_count":77,"authors":["Hisano, Junji","Kurosawa, Kiichi","Nomura, Yasunori"]}

In particular, the Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion is realized, and positivity of transverse gluons is manifestly violated in these solutions. In Landau gauge, the gluon-ghost vertex function offers a convenient possibility to define a nonperturbative running coupling. The infrared fixed point obtained from this coupling which determines the 2-point interactions of color-octet quark currents implies the existence of unphysical massless states which are necessary to escape the cluster decomposition of colored clusters. The gluon and ghost propagators, and the nonperturbative running coupling, are compared to recent lattice simulations. A significant deviation of the running coupling from the infrared behavior extracted in simulations of 3-point functions is attributed to an inconsistency of asymmetric subtraction schemes due to a consequence of the Kugo-Ojima criterion: infrared enhanced ghosts.","created":"2000-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Adelaide 2000/02/21"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Landau gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dyson-Schwinger equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"infrared problem"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"confinement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling constant: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"ghost"}],"num_refs":23,"citation_count":26,"authors":["Alkofer, Reinhard","von Smekal, Lorenz"]}

It is shown that the quark structure of the nucleon-nucleon wave function in the overlap region plays an important role in dibaryon decays, and known models of nucleon-nucleon interaction are analyzed with allowance for this circumstance. The decay width of a dibaryon is estimated as a function of its effective mass in nuclear matter.","created":"2000-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon resonance: dibaryon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi quark: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson baryon: vertex function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dibaryon: vertex function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon nucleon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon resonance: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dibaryon: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":34,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Obukhovsky, I.T.","Obukhovsky, A.I."]}

We review here some of these with emphasis on the effects of nonuniversalities of the gaugino masses at the unification scale on the neutralino-proton cross-section from scalar interactions. The review encompasses several models where gaugino mass nonuniversalities occur including SUGRA models and D brane models.

The Hadron Kinetic Model covers the intermediate energy regime of hadronic interactions, O(100 MeV) to O(5 GeV); it can satisfy two use cases for intranuclear transport, both as a hadronic interaction model to be used by the physics processes, and as a back-end to higher energy models. It is capable to handle meson-meson, meson-baryon, baryon-baryon interactions and baryon-antibaryon annihilation, including resonance excitation and deexcitation, as well as pion absorption. A large set of exclusive channels is implemented in the model. The Object Oriented design provides the basis for extensive code reuse by other models, such as cascade models or quantum molecular dynamics models; it also provides the means for easy extension or evolution of the system.","created":"2000-12-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Padua 2000/02/07"}],"num_refs":8,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Bellagamba, L.","Brunengo, A.","Di Salvo, Elvio","Pia, M.G."]}

The gluonic kernel in the infrared regime which generates the constituent mass via standard $DB{\\chi}S$, is calibrated to both $q{\\bar q}$ and qqq spectra, meson mass splittings, pion form factor,and other parameters. With this check, an exact evaluation of the $D{\\bar D}\\gamma$ vertex form factor $F(\\alpha)$ (normalized to F(0)=1), gives a multiplicative effect of $F^2(\\alpha)$ on the $B_s \\Rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ amplitude via D-meson triangle loop, where $\\alpha$ = $(p^2+M^2)/M^2$ is the off-shellness parameter of the exchanged D-meson of mass M and 4-momentum $p_\\mu$, and is a variables of the (internal)loop integration. Unfortunately, the $F^2(\\alpha)$ effect decreases the loop amplitude by a factor of 30 w.r.t. the point hadron value, resulting in a reduction of 3 orders of magnitude in long distance (hadronic) contributions to the $B_s \\Rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ decay rate, thus greatly impairing the visibility of such modes.

{"title":"A New scaling law for analyzing power in hadron production by transversely polarized baryons","abstract":"Experimental data on analyzing power for inclusive meson and baryon production in hadron-proton(polarized) collisions have been analyzed. It is found that the existing data can be described by a simple function of collision energy, transverse momentum (Pt) and a new scaling variable Xa = E/Ebeam. At beam energies above 40 GeV and Pt above 1 GeV/c the analyzing power is described by a function of Xa and Pt only (AN = F(Pt)G(Xa)) for both polarized proton fragmentation and central regions of proton-hadron collision. Comparison of data from Fermilab and new IHEP data measured using 40 GeV/c polarized proton beam was most decisive for the revelation of the above regularities. This new scaling law allows one to predict the analyzing powers for kinematic regions, not yet explored in experiments and constrains models of strong interactions. The new scaling law allows one also to use some reactions as polarimeters for experiments with a polarized beam.","created":"1999-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":55,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: polarized beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi- p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: polarized target"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p: polarized beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"x-dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parametrization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":40,"citation_count":5,"authors":["Abramov, V.V."]}
{"title":"Model independent constraints on leptoquarks from rare muon and tau lepton processes","abstract":"We perform a model independent analysis so as to constrain the leptoquark (LQ) models from negative searches for $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$, $\\mu \\to 3e$ decays (and analogous processes in the $\\tau$ sector), and coherent $\\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei. We considerably improve some constraints obtained by analyses known in the literature, analyses which we show have by far underestimated the LQ contributions to the $\\mu\\to 3e$. In particular we find that the coherent $\\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei mediated by the photon--conversion mechanism and the $\\mu \\to 3e$ decay are golden plates where the flavor changing leptoquark couplings, involving the second and third quark generations, can be strongly constrained. This is due to the fact that these processes get the enhancements by large $\\log(m_q^2/m^2_{LQ})$ terms which are induced by the so-called ``photon-penguin'' diagrams. These enhancements, which produce a mild GIM suppression in the amplitudes, have not been taken into account in the previous analyses. We show that the $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$ decay can set weaker constraints on the LQ models and this is because its amplitude is strongly GIM suppressed by the terms of order $O(m_q^2/m^2_{LQ})$. We also present the results for the corresponding constraints in the $\\tau$ sector. Finally the prospects of the future muon experiments for the improvement of the present bounds are analyzed and discussed.","created":"1999-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"PDG","source":"PDG","value":"S056LQI"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: rare decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: electromagnetic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron muon: transition"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"leptoquark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau: rare decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: penguin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":65,"citation_count":43,"authors":["Gabrielli, Emidio"]}

{"title":"Reconciling the two loop diagrammatic and effective field theory computations of the mass of the lightest CP - even Higgs boson in the MSSM","abstract":"The mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) has previously been computed including O(alpha alpha_s) two-loop contributions by an on-shell diagrammatic method, while approximate analytic results have also been obtained via renormalization-group-improved effective potential and effective field theory techniques. Initial comparisons of the corresponding two-loop results revealed an apparent discrepancy between terms that depend logarithmically on the supersymmetry-breaking scale, and different dependences of the non-logarithmic terms on the squark mixing parameter, X_t. In this paper, we determine the origin of these differences as a consequence of different renormalization schemes in which both calculations are performed. By re-expressing the on-shell result in terms of MS-bar parameters, the logarithmic two-loop contributions obtained by the different approaches are shown to coincide. The remaining difference, arising from genuine non-logarithmic two-loop contributions, is identified, and its effect on the maximal value of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass is discussed. Finally, we show that in a simple analytic approximation to the Higgs mass, the leading two-loop radiative corrections can be absorbed to a large extent into an effective one-loop expression by evaluating the running top quark mass at appropriately chosen energy scales.","created":"2000-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":29,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction: coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization: dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"threshold: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: interference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":36,"citation_count":416,"authors":["Carena, Marcela","Haber, H.E.","Heinemeyer, S.","Hollik, W.","Wagner, C.E.M.","Weiglein, G."]}

{"title":"Radion potential and brane dynamics","abstract":"We examine the cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum model in a dynamic setting where scalar fields are present in the bulk as well as the branes. This generates a mechanism similar to that of Goldberger-Wise for radion stabilization and the recovery of late-cosmology features in the branes. Due to the induced radion dynamics, the inflating branes roll towards the minimum of the radion potential, thereby exiting inflation and reheating the Universe. In the slow roll part of the potential, the 'TeV' branes have maximum inflation rate and energy as their coupling to the radion and bulk modes have minimum suppresion. Hence, when rolling down the steep end of the potential towards the stable point, the radion field (which appears as the inflaton of the effective 4D theory in the branes) decays very fast, reheats the Universe .This process results decayin a decrease of brane's canonical vacuum energy $\\Lambda_4$. However, at the minimum of the potential $\\Lambda_4$ is small but not neccessarily zero and the fine-tuning issue remains .Density perturbation constraints introduce an upper bound when the radion stabilizies. Due to the large radion mass and strong suppression to the bulk modes, moduli problems and bulk reheating do not occur. The reheat temperature and a sufficient number of e-folding constraints for the brane-universe are also satisfied. The model therefore recovers the radiation dominated FRW universe.","created":"2000-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Randall-Sundrum model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: anti-de Sitter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field equations: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radion: potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":29,"citation_count":21,"authors":["Mersini-Houghton, Laura"]}

Then, we present closed form expressions for the resummed cut rate for the inclusive decays B -> X_s gamma and B -> X_u e nu at next-to-leading order in the infrared logs. Using these results, we determine the range of cuts for which resummation is necessary, as well as the range for which the resummed expansion itself breaks down. We also use our results to extract the leading and next to leading infrared log contribution to the two loop differential rate. We find that for the phenomenologically interesting cut values, there is only a small region where the calculation is under control. Furthermore, the size of this region is sensitive to the parameter \\bar{\\Lambda}.

{"title":"Extra dimensions and strong neutrino nucleon interactions above 10**19-eV: Breaking the GZK barrier","abstract":"Cosmic ray events above $10^{20}$ eV are on the verge of confronting fundamental particle physics. The neutrino is the only candidate primary among established particles capable of crossing 100 Mpc intergalactic distances unimpeded. The magnitude of $\\nu N$ cross sections indicated by events, plus consistency with the Standard Model at low-energy, point to new physics of massive spin-2 exchange.

I calculate the parton densities to be used by the event generator in terms of MSbar densities. The method is generalizable. A particular motivation for treating the gluon-fusion process is to treat diffractive deep-inelastic scattering properly, since in diffractive scattering the gluon density dominates the quark densities. I also propose a modified algorithm for treating parton kinematics in event generators; the new algorithm results in much simpler formulae for the NLO corrections. A disadvantage of the new method is that some of the generated events may have negative weights. However, an adjustable cut-off function is present in the formalism, and this permits a renormalization-group-like transformation that can be used to at least reduce the proportion of events with negative weights.","created":"2000-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton nucleus: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"diffraction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fusion: photon gluon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"kinematics: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"showers: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: structure function"}],"num_refs":10,"citation_count":56,"authors":["Collins, John C."]}

In addition to global anomaly matching, we employ a recently proposed inequality constraint on the number of effective low energy (massless) degrees of freedom of a theory, based on the thermodynamic free energy. Several possible zero temperature phases are consistent with the constraints. A simple picture for the phase structure emerges if these theories choose the phase, consistent with global anomaly matching, that minimizes the massless degree of freedom count defined through the free energy. This idea suggests that confinement with the preservation of the global symmetries through the formation of massless composite fermions is in general not preferred. While our discussion is restricted mainly to bilinear condensate formation, higher dimensional condensates are considered for one case.

{"title":"Baryon number nonconservation and phase transitions at preheating","abstract":"Certain inflation models undergo pre-heating, in which inflaton oscillations can drive parametric resonance instabilities. We discuss several phenomena stemming from such instabilities, especially in weak-scale models; generically, these involve energizing a resonant system so that it can evade tunneling by crossing barriers classically. One possibility is a spontaneous change of phase from a lower-energy vacuum state to one of higher energy, as exemplified by an asymmetric double-well potential with different masses in each well. If the lower well is in resonance with oscillations of the potential, a system can be driven resonantly to the upper well and stay there (except for tunneling) if the upper well is not resonant. Another example occurs in hybrid inflation models where the Higgs field is resonant; the Higgs oscillations can be transferred to electroweak (EW) gauge potentials, leading to rapid transitions over sphaleron barriers and consequent B+L violation. Given an appropriate CP-violating seed, we find that preheating can drive a time-varying condensate of Chern-Simons number over large spatial scales; this condensate evolves by oscillation as well as decay into modes with shorter spatial gradients, eventually ending up as a condensate of sphalerons. We study these examples numerically and to some extent analytically. The emphasis in the present paper is on the generic mechanisms, and not on specific preheating models; these will be discussed in a later paper.","created":"2000-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"preheating"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflaton: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"resonance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sphaleron: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Chern-Simons number"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B+L number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs model: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: symmetry breaking"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":19,"authors":["Cornwall, John M.","Kusenko, Alexander"]}

{"title":"Electromagnetic properties of a neutrino stream","abstract":"In a medium that contains a neutrino background in addition to the matter particles, the neutrinos contribute to the photon self-energy as a result of the effective electromagnetic vertex that they acquire in the presence of matter. We calculate the contribution to the photon self-energy in a dense plasma, due to the presence of a gas of charged particles, or neutrinos, that moves as a whole relative to the plasma. General formulas for the transverse and longitudinal components of the photon polarization tensor are obtained in terms of the momentum distribution functions of the particles in the medium, and explicit results are given for various limiting cases of practical interest. The formulas are used to study the electromagnetic properties of a plasma that contains a beam of neutrinos. The transverse and longitudinal photon dispersion relations are studied in some detail. Our results do not support the idea that neutrino streaming instabilities can develop in such a system. We also indicate how the phenomenon of optical activity of the neutrino gas is modified due to the velocity of the neutrino background relative to the plasma. The general approach and results can be adapted to similar problems involving relativistic plasmas and high-temperature gauge theories in other environments.","created":"2000-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: background"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: gas"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: gas"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charged particle: velocity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: velocity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dispersion relation: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dispersion relation: transverse"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: gas"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"optics"}],"num_refs":28,"citation_count":10,"authors":["Nieves, Jose F."]}
{"title":"Families as neighbors in extra dimension","abstract":"We propose a new mechanism for explanation of the fermion hierarchy without introducing any family symmetries. Instead, we postulate that different generations live on different branes embedded in a relatively large extra dimension, where the gauge fields can propagate. The electroweak symmetry is broken on a separate brane, which is a source of exponentially decaying Higgs profile in the bulk. The resulting fermion masses and mixings are determined by an exponentially suppressed overlap of the fermion and Higgs wave functions and are automatically hierarchical even if all copies are identical and there is no hierarchy of distances. In this framework the well known pattern of the \"nearest neighbor mixing\" is predicted due to the fact that the families are literally neighbors in the extra space. This picture may also provide a new way of a hierarchically weak supersymmetry breaking, provided that the combination of three family branes is a non-BPS configuration, although each of them, individually taken, is. This results in exponentially weak supersymmetry breaking. We also discuss the issue of embedding identical branes in the compact spaces and localization of the fermionic zero modes.","created":"2000-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":11,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"family"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: >4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: condensation"}],"num_refs":24,"citation_count":121,"authors":["Dvali, G.R.","Shifman, Mikhail A."]}

We extend this past work to the more general case where initial values of the scale of compactification and the quantum number of the angular momentum $l$ of KK modes are not small. We perform analytic approaches based on the Mathieu equation as well as numerical calculations, and find that the expansion of the universe rapidly makes the KK field deviate from instability bands. As a result, KK modes are not enhanced sufficiently in an expanding universe in these two classes of models.","created":"2000-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: >4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion: harmonic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: Casimir"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"compactification"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":28,"citation_count":3,"authors":["Tsujikawa, Shinji"]}

{"title":"A $D^-$ brane alternative to the MSSM","abstract":"The success of SU(5)-like gauge coupling unification boundary conditions $g_3^2=g_2^2=5/3 g_1^2$ has biased most attempts to embed the SM interactions into a unified structure. After discussing the limitations of the orthodox approach, we propose an alternative that appears to be quite naturally implied by recent developments based on D-brane physics. In this new alternative: 1) The gauge group, above a scale of order 1 TeV, is the minimal left-right symmetric extension $SU(3)\\times SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{B-L}$ of the SM; 2) Quarks, leptons and Higgs fields come in three generations; 3) Couplings unify at an intermediate string scale $M_s= 9\\times 10^{11}$ GeV with boundary conditions $g_3^2=g_L^2=g_R^2=32/3 g_{B-L}^2$. This corresponds to the natural embedding of gauge interactions into D-branes and is different from the standard SO(10) embedding which corresponds to $k_{B-L}=8/3$. Unification only works in the case of three generations; 4) Proton stability is automatic due to the presence of $Z_2$ discrete R-parity and lepton parities. A specific Type IIB string orientifold model with the above characteristics is constructed. The existence of three generations is directly related to the existence of three complex extra dimensions. In this model the string scale can be identified with the intermediate scale and SUSY is broken also at that scale due to the presence of anti-branes in the vacuum. We discuss a number of phenomenological issues in this model including Yukawa couplings and a built-in axion solution to the strong-CP problem. The present framework could be tested by future accelerators by finding the left-right symmetric extension of the SM at a scale of order 1 TeV.","created":"2000-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":50,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(5)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model: D-brane"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: left-right"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Weinberg angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"orientifold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"family"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anomaly: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"axion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":101,"citation_count":141,"authors":["Aldazabal, G.","Ibanez, Luis E.","Quevedo, F."]}

The key observation is that superpotential interactions couple the flat directions to other fields, which acquire masses induced by the flat-direction vev that may be sufficiently small for them to be kinematically accessible to inflaton decay. The resulting plasma of inflaton decay products then may act on the flat directions via these superpotential Yukawa couplings, inducing thermal masses and supersymmetry-breaking A terms. In such cases the flat directions start their oscillations at an earlier time than usually estimated. The oscillations are also terminated earlier, due to evaporation of the flat direction condensate produced by its interaction with the plasma of inflaton decay products.

{"title":"The atmospheric neutrino anomaly without maximal mixing?","abstract":"We consider a pattern of neutrino masses in which there is an approximate mass degeneracy between the two mass eigenstates most coupled to the $\\nu_\\mu$ and $\\nu_\\tau$ flavour eigenstates. Earth-matter effects can lift this degeneracy and induce an effectively maximal mixing between these two generations. This occurs if $\\nu_e$'s contain comparable admixtures of the degenerate eigenstates, even rather small ones. This provides an explanation of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly in which the {\\it ab initio} introduction of a large mixing angle is not required. To test this possibility we perform a novel and detailed analysis of the 52 kiloton-year SuperKamiokande data, and we find that in a large region of parameter space the corresponding confidence levels are excellent. The most recent results from the Chooz reactor experiment, however, severely curtail this region, so that the conventional scenario with nearly maximal mixing angles --which we also analyse in detail-- is supported by the data.","created":"2000-01-17T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":23,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/mu"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/tau"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: angular distribution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: angular distribution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":64,"citation_count":33,"authors":["De Rujula, A.","Gavela, M.B.","Hernandez, P."]}

This requires either power law running of the couplings or logarithmic running extremely far above the string scale. In both cases it is difficult to arrange for the multiplet structure to give the MSSM result. For the case of power law running there is also enhanced sensitivity to the spectrum at the unification scale. For the case of logarithmic running there is a fine tuning problem associated with the light closed string Kaluza Klein spectrum which requires gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking on the ``visible'' brane with a dangerously low scale of supersymmetry breaking. Evading these problems in low string scale models requires a departure from the MSSM structure, which would imply that the success of gauge unification in the MSSM is just an accident.","created":"2000-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":11,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: unified field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":11,"authors":["Ghilencea, Dumitru M","Ross, Graham G."]}

In this paper I consider a particular aspect of EbyE analysis emphasizing global-variables variance comparisons and the central limit theorem. I find that the central limit theorem is, in a broader interpretation, a statement about the scale invariance of total variance for a measure distribution, which in turn relates to the scale-dependent symmetry properties of the distribution.. I further generalize this concept to the relationship between the scale dependence of a covariance matrix for all conserved measures defined on a dynamical system and a matrix of covariance integrals defined on two-point measure spaces, which points the way to a detailed description of the symmetry dynamics of a complex measure system.

The data are extremely well reproduced by our approach at all momenta and for sufficiently high energies. The relative virtues of Born amplitudes and of different kinds of eikonalizations are considered. An important point in this respect is that secondary structures are predicted in the differential cross-sections at increasing energies and these phenomena appear quite directly related to the procedure of eikonalizing the various Born amplitudes. We conclude that these secondary structures arise naturally within the eikonalized procedure (although their precise localization turns out to be model dependent).

The nontrivial minimization procedure makes it possible to determine the value of the soft cutoff in terms of the corresponding nonperturbative scale parameter which is inevitably presented in any nonperturbative model for the full gluon propagator. If the chosen Ansatz for the full gluon propagator is a realistic one, then our method uniquely determines the truly vacuum energy density, which is always finite, automatically negative and it has no imaginary part (stable vacuum).

This channel is truly unique, because instanton-induced attractive gg interaction \\cite{Shu_82} leads to unusually small sizes and strong coupling constants of these states, supplemented by unusually large mass scale, $M_0\\approx 4 GeV$, of the transition boundary to the perturbative regime. As pomeron is a small-size object by itself, these resonances may play a special role in its dynamics. Furthermore, we use more realistic description of the scalar gluonic spectral density without free parameters, and slightly modify the model to get correct chiral limit. We conclude that the non-perturbative part of the scalar contribution to the soft pomeron intercept is $\\Delta = >.05\\pm 0.015$, with comparable contributions from both $\\sigma$ and $G_0$.","created":"2000-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton nucleon: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: pomeron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spectral representation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: instanton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark antiquark: dipole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar meson"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"}],"num_refs":35,"citation_count":32,"authors":["Shuryak, Edward V."]}

The general formalism of such effects is described, and applications are made to a variety of flavor changing and CP-violating tree and loop processes. Results are described for three specific cases motivated by a specific heterotic string model and by phenomenological considerations, including cases in which all three families have different couplings, and those in which the first two families, but not the third, have the same couplings. Even within a specific theory the results are model dependent because of unknown quark and lepton mixing matrices. However, assuming that typical mixings are comparable to the CKM matrix, processes such as coherent mu-e conversion in a muonic atom, K^0-\\Bar{K}^0 and B-\\Bar{B} mixing, epsilon, and epsilon'/epsilon lead to significant constraints on Z' bosons in the theoretically and phenomenologically motivated range M_{Z'} \\sim 1 TeV.","created":"2000-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z': coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tree approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model: heterotic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"final state: (2lepton antilepton)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transition: electron muon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pseudoscalar meson: mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K0 anti-K0: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B0 anti-B0: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":72,"citation_count":335,"authors":["Langacker, Paul","Plumacher, Michael"]}

A recently proposed generalization of the so-called Fermion-Loop scheme is applied to the evaluation of observables at LEP 2 energies. Single-W processes are dominated by a regime of low momentum transfer of the outgoing electron and any high-energy Renormalization Scheme fails to give the correct description of the scale. The Fermion-Loop scheme automatically converts all couplings of the theory into couplings that are running at the appropriate scale. Therefore, in addition to represent the only scheme fully justified on a field-theoretical basis, the Fermion-Loop is the best starting point to include radiative corrections into single-W production. Numerical results are presented, showing a decrease in the predictions that can be sizeable.

The photon spectrum is obtained by integrating the photon rate over the space-time history of the plasma, adopting a boost invariant cylindrically symmetric transverse expansion of the system with different nuclear profile functions. Initial conditions obtained from a self-screened parton cascade calculation and, for comparison, from the HIJING model are used. Compared to an equilibrated plasma at the same initial energy density, taken from the self-screened parton cascade, a moderate suppression of the photon yield by a factor of one to five depending on the collision energy and the photon momentum is observed.

We found a new hard production mechanism which is related to the possibility for a real photon to fluctuate into a massless $q\\bar q$ pair in a chiral-odd spin configuration. Each helicity amplitude is given as a sum of a usual chiral-even contribution (when the helicities of quark and antiquark are antiparallel) and this additional chiral-odd part (where the helicities of quark and antiquark are parallel). The chiral-odd contribution is large, it leads to a dominance of the non spin-flip amplitude in a very broad region of intermediately high $|t|$. All amplitudes are expressed in terms of short distance asymptotics of the light-cone wave functions of vector meson (photon). We demonstrate that for each helicity amplitude there exists a soft non-factorizable contribution. We give arguments that for dominant non spin-flip helicity amplitude the relative contribution of the soft nonfactorizable interactions is numerically not large.","created":"2000-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon p: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum transfer: high"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hard scattering: scattering amplitude"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"helicity: amplitude analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"factorization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon quark: exclusive reaction"}],"num_refs":17,"citation_count":55,"authors":["Ivanov, D.Yu.","Kirschner, R.","Sch��fer, A.","Szymanowski, L."]}

The new symmetry is related to the possibility, supported by various investigations, that a parity-doubled spectrum develops as the number of fermions Nf is increased to a critical value above which it is expected that the symmetric phase is restored.

We find that typical sizes of delta P and delta Q_ij are 5-20% times the couplings (d_tgamma, d_tZ, d_tg) in the threshold region. Experimentally delta P can be measured efficiently using the CP-odd combination of the l+/l- momenta or of the l+/l- directions.

{"title":"Single spin asymmetries in inclusive high-energy hadron hadron collision processes","abstract":"It has been realized for quite a long time that single-spin experiments, in which one of the colliding objects is transversely polarized, can be helpful in studying the properties of strong interaction in general and in testing Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in particular. Striking effects have been observed in the past few years which deviate drastically from the expectation of the perturbative QCD parton model. These effects have received much attention. New experiments of the similar type are underway and/or planned. Different theoretical attempts have been made to understand these effects. In this review, the special role played by singly polarized high-energy hadron-hadron collisions in High Energy Spin Physics is emphasized. Characteristics of the available data for inclusive hadron productions are briefly summarized. Different theoretical approaches for such processes are reviewed with special attention to a non-perturbative model which explicitly takes the orbital motion of the valence quarks and hadronic surface effects into account. The connection between such asymmetries and hyperon polarization in unpolarized reactions is discussed. An example of the possible application of such experimental results in other processes is given.","created":"2000-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":63,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: transverse"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hard scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: transverse momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: higher-twist"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fragmentation function: spin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: angular momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: fragmentation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hyperon: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hyperon: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton nucleon: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":88,"citation_count":54,"authors":["Liang, Zuo-tang","Boros, C."]}

We point out that these branes could be ``fat'' and have a non-vanishing width in the dimensions reserved for gravitons. In this case the other particles, confined within a finite width, should have ``branon'' excitations. Chiral fermions behave differently from bosons under dimensional reduction, and they may --or may not-- be more localized than bosons. All these possibilities are in principle testable and distinguishable, they could yield spectacular signatures at colliders, such as the production of the first branon excitation of $\\gamma$'s or $Z$'s, decaying into their ground state plus a quasi-continuum of graviton recurrences. We explore these ideas in the realm of a future lepton collider and we individuate a {\\it dimensiometer}: an observable that would cleanly diagnose the number of large ``extra'' dimensions.","created":"2000-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"graviton: excited state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton antilepton: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"graviton: emission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: resonance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":32,"citation_count":89,"authors":["De Rujula, A.","Donini, A.","Gavela, M.B.","Rigolin, S."]}

{"title":"SUSY Higgs at the LHC: Effects of light charginos and neutralinos","abstract":"In view of the latest LEP data we consider the effects of charginos and neutralinos on the two-photon and bbbar signatures of the Higgs at the LHC. Assuming the usual GUT inspired relation between M_1 and M_2 we show that there are only small regions with moderate tanbeta and large stop mixings that may be dangerous. Pathological models not excluded by LEP which have degeneracy between the sneutrino and the chargino are however a real danger because of large branching fraction of the Higgs into invisibles. We have also studied models where the gaugino masses are not unified at the GUT scale. We take M_1=M_2/10 as an example where large reductions in the signal at the LHC can occur. However we argue that such models with a very light neutralino LSP may give a too large relic density unless the sleptons are light. We then combine this cosmological constraint with neutralino production with light sfermions to further reduce the parameter space that precludes observability of the Higgs at the LHC. We still find regions of parameter space where the drops in the usual Higgs signals at the LHC can be drastic. Nonetheless, in such scenarios where Higgs may escape detection we show that one should be able to produce all charginos and neutralinos. Although the heavier of these could cascade into the Higgs, the rates are not too high and the Higgs may not always be recovered this way.","created":"2000-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":38,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"chargino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: associated production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: CERN LHC Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle --> 2photon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle --> 2bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"14000 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":71,"citation_count":59,"authors":["Belanger, G.","Boudjema, F.","Donato, F.","Godbole, R.","Rosier-Lees, S."]}

These models allow for solutions to the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems that do not require altering successful predictions for the charged fermions or introducing sterile neutrinos. Although Yukawa matrices are hierarchical in the models we consider, the mixing between second- and third-generation neutrinos is naturally large. We first present a quantitative analysis of a minimal model proposed in earlier work, consisting of a global fit to fermion masses and mixing angles, including the most important renormalization group effects. We then propose two new variant models: The first reproduces all important features of the SU(5)xU(2) unified theory with neither SU(5) nor U(2).

We show that the $\\omega$ meson mass decreases with both temperature and chemical potential with a general tendency, while near the critical point several $\\omega$ meson masses become degenerate due to the multiple solutions of the SCC.

These specific predictions make it possible to submit the model to a scrupulous test at B factories and hadron colliders.","created":"2000-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Les Arcs 2000/03/11"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: left-right"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(2) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K0 anti-K0: mixing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B/s0 anti-B/s0: interference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B0 anti-B0: mixing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"proposed experiment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B --> J/psi(3100) K0(S)"}],"num_refs":22,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Ball, Patricia"]}

{"title":"Strong decays of the glueball in a scaled effective Lagrangian","abstract":"We calculate the scalar glueball decays into ���� , ���� , ���� ��� and K K within a modified version of the NJL model which implements the QCD trace anomaly. The glueball is assumed to be the f 0 (1500). It is coupled to the quarks due to its mixing with the scalar isoscalar mesons. The decay widths then contain a contribution coming from the triangle Feynman diagram. Moreover, they contain two additional contributions corresponding to the local decay of the glue component of the f 0 (1500): one comes from the process of regularization of the quark loop, the other from the interaction term a 2 �� 2 �� 2 . Except for the ���� ��� case, this local decay reduces the value of the width. The axial anomaly is introduced via a mass term for the �� ���. As far as the lightest scalar glueball is identified with the f 0 (1500), the model cannot reproduce at the same time the dynamical properties of scalars and pseudoscalars. Since we do not include a model of confinement, we need to use a large quark mass (725 MeV) in our calculations. This leads to unphysical results for the two-pion decay width. A definitive test of our model awaits the introduction of a model of confinement, which we hope to include in a future work.","created":"2000-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":18,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.39.Fe"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.39.Mk"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.40.-n"},{"source":"author","value":"Scalar mesons"},{"source":"author","value":"Chiral Lagrangian"},{"source":"author","value":"NJL"},{"source":"author","value":"Glueball"},{"source":"author","value":"���� , ���� ��� decays"},{"source":"author","value":"����,       ������� decays"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glueball: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glueball: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"f0(1500)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pseudoscalar meson: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Jona-Lasinio-Nambu model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glueball: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anomaly: axial"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glueball: coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":28,"citation_count":3,"authors":["Jaminon, M.","Mathot, M.","Van den Bossche, B."]}

The more the flavors are, the faster the gluon condensates decrease. In the three-flavor case, the gluon condensates would be vanish (or the scale invariance would be restored) approximately at the temperature of 180 MeV.","created":"2000-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":3,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: determinant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partition function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"instanton: weak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dependence: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":22,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Liu, Jue-Ping"]}

{"title":"Quark confinement physics from quantum chromodynamics","abstract":"We show the construction of the dual superconducting theory for the confinement mechanism from QCD in the maximally abelian (MA) gauge using the lattice QCD Monte Carlo simulation. We find that essence of infrared abelian dominance is naturally understood with the off-diagonal gluon mass $m_{\\rm off} \\simeq 1.2 {\\rm GeV}$ induced by the MA gauge fixing. In the MA gauge, the off-diagonal gluon amplitude is forced to be small, and the off-diagonal gluon phase tends to be random. As the mathematical origin of abelian dominance for confinement, we demonstrate that the strong randomness of the off-diagonal gluon phase leads to abelian dominance for the string tension. In the MA gauge, there appears the macroscopic network of the monopole world-line covering the whole system. We investigate the monopole-current system in the MA gauge by analyzing the dual gluon field $B_\\mu$. We evaluate the dual gluon mass as $m_B = 0.4 \\sim$ 0.5GeV in the infrared region, which is the lattice-QCD evidence of the dual Higgs mechanism by monopole condensation. Owing to infrared abelian dominance and infrared monopole condensation, QCD in the MA gauge is describable with the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory.","created":"2000-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Tokyo 1998/12/14"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: confinement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: lattice"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: superconductivity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"duality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge: abelian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge fixing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"infrared problem"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: monopole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory: action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"condensation: monopole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":16,"citation_count":21,"authors":["Suganuma, H.","Amemiya, K.","Tanaka, A.","Ichie, H."]}

We start with a set of model parameters which reproduces the binding energy of the deuteron and the NN phase shifts, and discuss the results of such a model for the baryon spectra.

The mass and radius of strange stars are constructed for absolutely stable three-flavor quark matter, where the energy per baryon number lies below the energy per baryon for 56Fe. The effect of the magnetic field on the electrostatic potential of electrons inside and in close vicinity outside the quark surface of the star is studied. We find that the interior magnetic field H<~1018G does not change the mass and radius of the equilibrium star appreciably, but changes the interior structure of a star. Depending on the value of the crust potential and the electron chemical potential at the base of the nuclear crust, our studies show that the strong surface magnetic field 1.0��1014<~H<~3.0��1016G leads to a considerable reduction of the electrostatic potential which is responsible for the tunneling of ions from the nuclear crust towards the quark surface. For those values of the magnetic fields, strange stars are unlikely to possess a thick nuclear crust.

{"title":"Leptonic electroweak model with no ad hoc parity-breaking prescriptions and no Higgs particles","abstract":"The leptonic sector of the standard model is revisited in the light of a recentstrictly covariant, generalized quantum field formalism that naturally accountsfor the ���maximal P-violation��� effect without needing to postulate any true failureof P mirror symmetry. In full accordance with neutrino-antineutrinophenomenology, such an approach strictly predicts the nonexistence ofright-handed (massless) neutrinos and left-handed (massless) antineutrinos: itspontaneously leads to a universal theory of a merely left-handed massless fermionand a merely right-handed corresponding antifermion, where such particles maynow be P-symmetrically interpreted as just two pseudoscalar-charge conjugatedobjects being the ordinary mirror image of each other. On these grounds, a weakisospin of pseudoscalar components is introduced, which can alternately yield adouble���either SU(2)L (leptonic) or SU(2)R (antileptonic)���variety of SU(2)representations, each with its own weak-hypercharge variety. Hence two equallyallowable SU(2) ��� U(1) massless gauge schemes are covariantly built, the formerincluding (right-handed) antileptons as SU(2)L-singlets and the latter including(left-handed) leptons as SU(2)R-singlets. In either alternative scheme, the���charged��� lepton and antilepton can but bear as yet an electric charge quiteindefinite in sign: they can really be made two electric charge conjugatedeigenstates (with opposite eigenvalues) only by acquiring mass and turning intoDirac particles. Herein the charged-lepton mass appearance no longer looks likejust an external ���accident��� connected with a hypothetical coupling to a Higgsboson; it rather becomes an essential internal requirement for the generation ofthe leptonic electromagnetic gauge coupling. A suitable effective mechanism ofmass production is shown to be provided by simply introducing a net ���vacuum���Higgs isodoublet field merely including the three Goldstone freedom degreesand not including the Higgs-boson excitation: such a field still has a nonzerovacuum expectation value and still generates SSB and Weinberg mixing, thoughwith the only further (internal) effect of giving mass to both the intermediatevector bosons and the charged lepton (antilepton). Two equivalent covariantelectroweak final schemes for either leptons or antileptons are thus obtainedwhich contain no Higgs-boson couplings and can all the same reproduce thewell-established standard results. Either scheme may be said not to be P-symmetricbut for the presence of the neutral weak current coupling, as a mere outcome ofthe mixed (and not purely pseudoscalar) nature of the ���electroweak��� effectivecharge therein involved.","created":"2000-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":32,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: left-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"massless"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"antilepton: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"isospin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge conjugation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: doublet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass generation"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Ziino, G."]}
{"title":"Roper resonances as vibrating flux tubes between quarks","abstract":"The Roper resonances of the nucleon are described as transverse vibrations of astretched flux tube between the three quarks. The proton is modeled using currentmass quarks interacting with a confining linear flux tube potential plus thespin-dependent parts of a one-gluon exchange potential. The proton ground state hasno vibrations and the confining flux tube has the minimum length required toconnect the three quarks. The flux tube has a V or Y shape of two or threesegments, depending on the locations of the quarks. The vibrations of the fluxtube have nodes at the quarks and at the apex of the Y-shaped configuration andprovide the vibrational excitation energy to describe the proton excitations. Theamplitude of the transverse vibrations is found from a geometric analysis, anddepends on the string constant of the flux tube potential. The Roper 1. 440-GeVresonance energy is very nearly reproduced by the vibration with mode number1 acting in only one segment of the flux tube. The vibration with mode number2 in one segment of the flux tube closely reproduces the second proton excitationat 1.710 GeV.

The ratios show little dependence with the model parameters.

{"title":"Composite antisymmetric tensor bosons in a four-fermion interaction model","abstract":"We discuss the phenomenological consequences of theUA(1)symmetry-breaking two-flavour four-fermion antisymmetric (AS) Lorentz tensor interaction Lagrangians. We use the recently developed methods that respect the `duality' symmetry of this interaction. Starting from the Fierz transform of the two-flavour 't?Hooft interaction (a four-fermion Lagrangian with AS tensor interaction terms augmented by Nambu and Jona-Lasinio (NJL)-type Lorentz scalar interaction responsible for dynamical symmetry breaking and quark mass generation), we find the following. (a) Four antisymmetric tensor and four AS pseudotensor bosons exist which satisfy a mass relation previously derived for scalar and pseudoscalar mesons from the 't?Hooft interaction. (b) Antisymmetric tensor bosons mix with vector bosons via one-fermion-loop effective couplings so that both kinds of bosons have their masses shifted and the fermions (quarks) acquire anomalous magnetic moment form factors that explicitly violate chiral symmetry. (c) The mixing of massive AS tensor fields with vector fields leads to two sets of spin-1 states. The second set of spin-1 mesons is heavy and has not been observed. Moreover, at least one member of this second set is tachyonic, under standard assumptions about the source and strength of the AS tensor interaction. The tachyonic state also shows up as a pole in the space-like region of the electromagnetic form factors. (d) The mixing of axial-vector fields with antisymmetric tensor bosons is proportional to the (small) isospin-breaking up-down quark mass difference, so the mixing-induced mass shift is negligible. (e) The AS tensor version of the Veneziano-WittenUA(1)symmetry-breaking interaction does not lead to tachyons, or any AS tensor field propagation to leading order inNC.","created":"2000-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":16,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Jona-Lasinio-Nambu model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"four-fermion interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dynamical symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Bethe-Salpeter equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tensor meson: composite"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tensor meson: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tachyon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: magnetic moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Goldstone particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"duality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":31,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Dmitrasinovic, Veljko"]}

The models studied are of the Friedberg���Lee type, which exhibit dynamical bag formation due to the coupling of quarks to a scalar composite gluon field �� . It is shown in the Wigner���Seitz approximation that the high density behavior of such models depends essentially on the leading power of the quark��� �� coupling vertex. By insisting that the parameters of any soliton model be chosen to reproduce single nucleon properties, this high-density behavior then selects a promising class of models that better fit the empirical results ��� the chiral chromodielectric models. The presence of a scalar meson is shown to provide saturation as well as an increase of the proton charge radius with nuclear density. We go beyond the usual Wigner���Seitz approximation by introducing the disorder necessary to reproduce the liquid state, using the significant structure theory of physical chemistry. We study nuclear matter, with particular interest in the transition to a quark plasma, showing that even the simplest version of the model provides a reasonable qualitative fit to both the empirical nuclear matter equation of state and single nucleon properties.","created":"2000-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":29,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"24.85.+p"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.39.Ki"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"21.65.+f"},{"source":"author","value":"Nontopological soliton"},{"source":"author","value":"Chiral chromodielectric model"},{"source":"author","value":"Friedberg���Lee model"},{"source":"author","value":"Nuclear matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"soliton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: (sigma meson quark)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: dielectric"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: liquid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":34,"citation_count":14,"authors":["Barnea, N.","Walhout, T.S."]}

The periodically bent crystal serves as an undulator. We investigate the dependence of the intensities of both the ordinary channelling and the undulator radiations on the parameters of the periodically bent channel with simultaneous account for the de-channelling effect of the positrons. We demonstrate that there is a range of parameters in which the undulator radiation dominates over the channelling one and the characteristic frequencies of both types of radiation are well separated.

{"title":"The link between neutrino masses and proton decay in supersymmetric unification","abstract":"Following recent joint works with K. Babu and F. Wilczek, I stress here that supersymmetric unification, based on symmetries like SO(10) or a string-derived G(224)=SU(2) L ��SU(2) R ��SU(4) C possesses some crucial features that are intimately linked to each other. They are (a) gauge-coupling unification; (b) the masses and mixings of all fermions, including especially the neutrinos; and last but not least (c) proton decay. In this context, it is noted that the value of \\(m_{v_L^\\tau } \\sim 1/20{\\text{ }}eV\\), suggested by the Super-Kamiokande result, goes extremely well with the unification-hypothesis, based on the ideas of (i) SU(4)-color, (ii) left-right symmetry, and (iii) supersymmetry. A concrete proposal is presented within an economical SO(10)-framework that makes five successful predictions for the masses and mixings of the quarks and the charged leptons. The same framework explains why the ����������� oscillation angle is so large \\((\\sin ^2 2\\theta _{\\nu _\\mu \\nu _\\tau }^{osc} \\approx 0.82 - 0.96)\\) and yet V bc is so small (���0.04), both in accord with observation. The influence of the masses of the neutrinos and of the charged fermions on proton decay is discussed concretely, within this framework. The \\(\\bar \\nu K^ + \\) mode is expected to be dominant for SUSY SO(10) as well as SU(5). A distinctive feature of the SO(10) model, however, is the likely prominence of the ��+ K 0 mode, which, for SU(5), is highly suppressed. Our study shows that while current limits on the rate of proton decaying into \\(\\bar \\nu K^ + \\) are compatible with theoretical expectations, improvements in these limits by a factor of 5���10 should either turn up events, or else the SO(10)-framework described here, which is otherwise so successful, will be in jeopardy. Prominence of the��+ K 0 mode, if observed, will be most significant in that it will reveal the intriguing link that exists between neutrino masses and proton decay in the context of supersymmetric unification.","created":"2000-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Dubna 1999/06/28"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SO(10)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: SU(4)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: left-right"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(5)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/tau: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking: SO(10)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B-L number"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p --> K+ antineutrino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p --> K0 muon+"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Pati, Jogesh C."]}

{"title":"Is the nucleon deformed?","abstract":"The pion cloud of the nucleon interacts with the valence quarks in the nucleon along the spin direction of the quarks. Thus one expects a specific strong interaction between the valence quarks and the pion cloud in and opposite to the direction of the spin. This can lead to a negative intrinsic deformation of the nucleon. Such an oblate intrinsic deformation of the nucleon could be measured in the photoexcitation of the �� resonance from the proton. The �� resonance decays by emitting a pion. Its angular distribution allows to determine the multipolarity of the photo or the electro excitation of the �� resonance. The leading term is a magnetic dipole transition, but one finds also a strong longitudinal (C2) and transversal (E2) quadrupole excitation. This has been attributed to quadrupole deformed orbits of the valence quarks. The tensor force from pion or gluon exchange would admix to the single particle quark wave functions ���d��� states and allow a C2 E2 transition. But this intrinsic quadrupole deformation is far too small and cannot explain the data. It is shown, that the pair current from pion and gluon exchange allows a double spin flip of two valence quarks, which describes a C2 E2 transition. The so calculated Sachs form factor is in good agreement with recent data from Mainz, Bonn and Brookhaven.\n\nIn the second part we study within the same model the possible formation of scalar-isoscalar and vector-isovector diquarks. It is first shown that an improved variational calculation yields the same results as the Fadeev approach. Models with gluon exchange show a stronger scalar-isoscalar diquark formation, compared to models without gluons. But in both cases the dynamical diquark formation seems not to be so strong, that diquarks can be treated for low energy phenomena as ���elementary��� particles.","created":"2000-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Erice 1999/09/17"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: valence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi quark: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: deformation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon nucleon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Delta(1232): photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor: multipole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: diquark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bound state: (diquark quark)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: variational"}],"num_refs":21,"citation_count":6,"authors":["Faessler, A."]}

The quarks and anti-quarks interact through a linear potential. We obtain an analytic formula for the isospin averaged valence quark distribution in the chiral and large Nc limits.

We find that the anti-quark content is small at a low value of Q^2. Using these distributions as initial conditions for Q^2 evolution, we compare with experimental measurements of the structure function xF_3(x,Q^2) and find reasonable agreement.

{"title":"Frame independence of exclusive amplitudes in light front quantization","abstract":"While the particle-number-conserving convolution formalism established in the Drell-Yan-West reference frame is frequently used to compute exclusive amplitudes in the light-front quantization, this formalism is limited to only those frames where the light-front helicities are not changed and the good (plus) component of the current remains unmixed. For an explicit demonstration of such criteria, we present the relations between the current matrix elements in the two typical reference frames used for calculations of the exclusive amplitudes, i.e., the Drell-Yan-West and Breit frames, and investigate both pseudoscalar and vector electromagnetic currents in detail. We find that the light-front helicities are unchanged and the good component of the current does not mix with the other components of the current under the transformation between these two frames. Thus, the pseudoscalar and vector form factors obtained by the diagonal convolution formalism in both frames must indeed be identical. However, such coincidence between the Drell-Yan-West and Breit frames does not hold in general. We give an explicit example in which the light-front helicities are changed and the plus component of the current is mixed with other components under the change of reference frame. In such a case, the relationship between the frames should be carefully analyzed before the established convolution formalism in the Drell-Yan-West frame is used.","created":"2000-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantization: light front"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"amplitude analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"current: pseudoscalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"current: vector"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"helicity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unitarity: transformation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon meson: absorption"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":10,"citation_count":10,"authors":["Ji, Chueng-Ryong","Mitchell, Chad"]}

{"title":"Axial baryon number nonconserving antisymmetric tensor four quark effective interaction","abstract":"We discuss the phenomenological consequences of the UA(1) symmetry-breaking two-flavor four-fermion antisymmetric (AS) Lorentz tensor interaction Lagrangians. We use the recently developed methods that respect the ���duality��� symmetry of this interaction. Starting from the Fierz transform of the two-flavor ���t Hooft interaction (a four-fermion Lagrangian with AS tensor interaction terms augmented by a Nambu���Jona-Lasinio- type Lorentz scalar interaction responsible for dynamical symmetry breaking and quark mass generation), we find the following. (1) Four antisymmetric tensor and four antisymmetric pseudotensor bosons exist which satisfy a mass relation previously derived for scalar and pseudoscalar mesons from the ���t Hooft interaction. (2) Antisymmetric tensor bosons mix with vector bosons via one-fermion-loop effective couplings so that both kinds of bosons have their masses shifted and the fermions (quarks) acquire anomalous magnetic moment form factors that explicitly violate chiral symmetry. (3) The mixing of massive antisymmetric tensor fields with vector fields leads to two sets of spin-one states. The second set of spin-one mesons is heavy and has not been observed. Moreover at least one member of this second set is tachyonic, under standard assumptions about the source and strength of the antisymmetric tensor interaction. The tachyonic state also shows up as a pole in the spacelike region of the EM form factors. (4) The axial-vector fields��� mixing with antisymmetric tensor bosons is proportional to the (small) isospin-breaking up-down quark mass difference, so the mixing-induced mass shift of axial vector mesons is negligible. (5) The antisymmetric tensor version of the Veneziano-Witten UA(1) symmetry-breaking interaction does not lead to tachyons, or any antisymmetric tensor field propagation to leading order in NC.

{"title":"Quark cluster model and confinement","abstract":"How confinement of quarks is implemented for multi-hadron systems in the quark cluster model is reviewed. In order to learn the nature of the confining interaction for fermions we first study 1+1 dimensional QED and QCD, in which the gauge field can be eliminated exactly and generates linear interaction of fermions. Then, we compare the two-body potential model, the flip-flop model and the Born-Oppenheimer approach in the strong coupling lattice QCD for the meson-meson system. Having shown how the long-range attraction between hadrons, van der Waals interaction, shows up in the two-body potential model, we discuss two distinct attempts beyond the two-body potential model: one is a many-body potential model, the flip-flop model, and the other is the Born-Oppenheimer approach in the strong coupling lattice QCD. We explain how the emergence of the long-range attraction is avoided in these attempts. Finally, we present the results of the application of the flip-flop model to the baryon-baryon scattering in the quark cluster model.","created":"2000-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"review"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum electrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: cluster"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: confinement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Born-Oppenheimer approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon baryon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon nucleon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon hyperon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: orbit"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Koike, Y.","Morimatsu, O.","Yazaki, K."]}

If the electromagnetic coupling constant exceeds 0.62 (Z= 85), then in a simple model with a finite-size nucleus, the lower electron level crosses the boundary of the negative-energy continuum (i.e., Dirac sea), and a hole (i.e., positively charged fermion) appears in the negative-energy continuum. An equation is obtained that describes the levels of the ground and excited electron states in a strong Coulomb field of the nucleus. The critical nucleus charge is found for a few lowest electron states. The critical charge in 2+1 dimensions is significantly smaller than in 3+1 dimensions. The problem is reduced to the case of a bounded Coulomb field in 1+1 dimensions without a magnetic field. The interaction of a fermion and an external scalar field in 2+1 and 1+1 dimensions is investigated.","created":"2000-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum electrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electromagnetic field: external field"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electromagnetic field: high"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus: finite size"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus: charge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: Coulomb"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"continuum limit"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dirac equation"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Khalilov, V.R."]}

{"title":"Gauge independence of Abelian and monopole dominances in QCD","abstract":"It is believed that quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory describing strong interaction. To understand confinement mechanism in QCD is one of the most important and interesting problem. The attractive scenario was proposed by 't Hooft. QCD, after abelian projection, can be regarded as an abelian theory with electric charges and magnetic monopoles. The confinement of quarks can be explained as the dual Meissner effect which is due to the condensation of these monopoles. According to this scenario, the QCD vacuum is dual to the ordinary superconductor and the monopoles play the role of the Cooper pairs. However abelian monopole condensation after abelian projection in some gauges can not explain color confinement in QCD. Abelian neutral but color non-singlet states are not confined. Gauge independence of monopole condensation is necessary for color confinement. We have shown abelian and monopole dominances numerically in maximally abelian gauge. Here the monopole dominance as well as the abelian dominance are proved generally after abelian projection even without any gauge fixing. And it is also possible to perform the numerical check of this result by using the lattice Monte Carlo simulation.","created":"2000-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":2,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Kanazawa 1999/10/11"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: confinement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: superconductivity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge: abelian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnetic monopole: condensation"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":5,"authors":["Fujimoto, S.","Kato, S.","Suzuki, T.","Tsunemi, T."]}
{"title":"Nucleon elastic form-factors and local duality","abstract":"Using a newly obtained sample of inclusive electron-proton scattering data in the nucleon resonance region we have extracted the proton magnetic form factor, utilizing the quark-hadron duality concept. The extraction is in good agreement with direct measurements. Similarly, utilizing quark-hadron duality, a relation can be derived between the ratio of longitudinal to transverse deep inelastic electron-proton scattering cross sections and the ratio of the electric to magnetic proton elastic form factors. Again, the extracted ratio agrees reasonably with the existing world data. This agreement is a first experimental verification of duality in the longitudinal channel, and suggests that effects of higher-twist operators are suppressed on average in both the longitudinal and transverse electron-nucleon scattering processes.","created":"2000-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":5,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon resonance: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor: magnetic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor: electric"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"duality: quark hadron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section: transverse"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":34,"authors":["Ent, R.","Keppel, C.E.","Niculescu, I."]}

{"title":"Calculation of the distribution of scalar glueball strength","abstract":"In an earlier work we introduced a covariant model of quarkonium-glueball mixing and calculated the wave functions of the various mixed scalar-isoscalar states:���f0(980), f0(1370), f0(1500), and f0(1770). In the present work we introduce the widths of these states and describe glueball mixing with the f0(400���1200) resonance using a perturbative scheme. Part of our motivation lies in the recent work of Narison who used QCD sum-rule techniques to study the distribution of glueball strength among scalar, pseudoscalar, and tensor mesons. We find little change of our previous results with little strength in the energy region below the f0(980) resonance. Our result is in contrast to the result of the QCD sum-rule analysis that suggests that there is a good deal of glueball strength in the region near or below 1 GeV.","created":"2000-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar meson"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glueball"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tensor: energy-momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":6,"citation_count":3,"authors":["Celenza, L.

{"title":"The status of the solar neutrino problem in the resonant spin-flavor precession scenario with twisting solar magnetic fields","abstract":"Resonant spin-flavor precession scenario with twisting solar magnetic fields has been confronted with the solar neutrino data from various ongoing experiments. In particular, the anticorrelation apparent in the Homestake solar neutrino data has been taken seriously to constrain the twisting profiles of the magnetic field in the convective zone of the Sun. The twisting profiles, thus derived, have been used to calculate the neutrino detection rates for the Homestake, Kamiokande (super-Kamiokande) and the gallium experiments. It is found that the presence of twisting reduces the degree of anticorrelation in all the solar neutrino experiments. However, the anticorrelation in the Homestake experiment is expected to be more pronounced. Moreover, the anticorrelation of solar neutrino flux emerging from the southern solar hemisphere is expected to be stronger than that for the neutrinos emerging from the northern solar hemisphere.","created":"2000-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":16,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"resonance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnetic field: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flux"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"deep underground detector"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Dev, S.","Sharma, J.D."]}

The results show that this cross section can be about 45 fb with our chosen input parameters at the CERN LHC.

{"title":"Neutrino beams: mu decay versus pi decay","abstract":"We propose a preliminary comparison in terms of general features, neutrino yields and event rates, of neutrino factories based on muon decay and conventional neutrino beams based on pion decay. The comparison focuses on high-energy neutrinos, with average energy of 10 GeV or more. Emphasis is put on beams designed for investigations of long-baseline neutrino oscillations. Performance for conventional short-baseline neutrino experimentation is also considered. In both types of facilities, neutrino yields and event rates increase steeply with the average energy of the neutrino parents. At equal energy of the parent, �� �� rates about 100 times larger and �� e rates more than 10 000 times larger appear possible with neutrino factories. This large yield of high-energy �� e that can be tagged by lepton number (charge) recognition in the neutrino detector, is considered the most important new feature of neutrino factories. A wide range of physics goals including a thorough study of the leptonic mixing-matrix and possibly of CP violation, can be addressed. The decay of a well-known number of muons provides a well-defined neutrino flux, free of the traditional uncertainties on the number and distribution of parent hadrons that plague conventional neutrino beams: one of the major advantages of the neutrino factory. In addition, the neutrino factory provides beams which are more flexible, tunable, serve simultaneously different baselines, and provide more neutrinos per unit of invested energy. Since only minor shielding is required in the neutrino factory, short-baseline neutrino detectors can profit from very intense and collimated beams. Sophisticated devices of small dimensions will be able to replace the traditional large coarse-grain detectors.","created":"2000-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Lyon 1999/07/05"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: particle source"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: yield"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"}],"num_refs":5,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Palladino, V."]}

The valence quark model is obtained as a variational approximation to hadron dynamics. A succession of better approximations to the soliton picture are obtained. The next simplest case corresponds to a system of interacting valence, ���sea��� and anti-quarks. We also obtain this ���embellished��� parton model directly from the valence quark system through a unitary transformation. Using the solitonic point of view, we estimate the quark and anti-quark distributions of 2d QCD. Possible applications to deep inelastic structure functions are pointed out.","created":"2000-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.39.Ki"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.60.-r"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.39.Dc"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Aw"},{"source":"author","value":"Soliton model"},{"source":"author","value":"Baryons"},{"source":"author","value":"Quantum hadron dynamics"},{"source":"author","value":"Skyrme model"},{"source":"author","value":"Parton model"},{"source":"author","value":"Valence quarks"},{"source":"author","value":"Anti-quarks"},{"source":"author","value":"Deep inelastic scattering"},{"source":"author","value":"QCD"},{"source":"author","value":"Structure functions"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"soliton: topological"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: valence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: sea"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: variational"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"antiquark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"deep inelastic scattering: structure function"}],"num_refs":11,"citation_count":4,"authors":["John, V.","Krishnaswami, Govind S.","Rajeev, S.G."]}

{"title":"Some aspects of R-parity violating supersymmetry","abstract":"I briefly review a scenario where R-parity is explicitly broken through a term bilinear in the lepton and Higgs superfields in the superpotential. An immediate consequence of the presence of this term is the generation of a massive neutrino at the tree level. Constraints on the parameter space are discussed in the context of recent super-Kamiokande results on atmospheric neutrinos. The testability of such models is emphasized through the observation of comparable numbers of muons and taus, produced together with the H���-boson, in decays of the lightest neutralino. Some other phenomenological implications of such a scenario are also discussed.","created":"2000-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":6,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Chennai 2000/01/03"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass generation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: KAMIOKANDE"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Roy, S."]}

In particular it guarantees the vanishing of the dangerous phases that were at the root of the so called SUSY CP problem. Such a symmetric gauge structure is independently motivated by the smallness of neutrino masses that arise via seesaw mechanism automatic in the theory. The minimal version of this theory also provides an explanation of the smallness of �����/�� as a consequence of the high scale parity invariance.","created":"2000-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Chennai 2000/01/03"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: left-right"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(2) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"superpotential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass generation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CKM matrix matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K0 anti-K0"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":19,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Mohapatra, R.N."]}
