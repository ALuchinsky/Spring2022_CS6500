{"title":"New insights into the perturbative structure of electroweak Sudakov logarithms","abstract":"To match the expected experimental precision at future linear colliders, improved theoretical predictions beyond next-to-leading order are required. At the anticipated energy scale of sqrt(s)=1 TeV the electroweak virtual corrections are strongly enhanced by collinear-soft Sudakov logarithms of the form log^2(s/M^2), with M being the generic mass scale of the W and Z bosons. By choosing an appropriate gauge, we have developed a formalism to calculate such corrections for arbitrary electroweak processes. As an example we consider in this letter the process e^+e^- --> f fbar and study the perturbative structure of the electroweak Sudakov logarithms by means of an explicit two-loop calculation. In this way we investigate how the Standard Model, with its mass gap between the photon and Z boson in the neutral sector, compares to unbroken theories like QED and QCD. In contrast to what is known for unbroken theories we find that the Sudakov logarithms are not exclusively given by the so-called rainbow diagrams, owing to the mass gap and the charged-current interactions. In spite of this, we nevertheless observe that the two-loop corrections are consistent with an exponentiation of the one-loop corrections. In this sense the Standard Model behaves like an unbroken theory at high energies.","created":"2000-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: radiative correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor: Sudakov"}],"num_refs":15,"citation_count":63,"authors":["Beenakker, W.","Werthenbach, A."]}

Method a) requires far less computer time than method b) but we find that it is too imprecise for precision studies. The lacking treatment of partonic polarization in the initial state shower results in relative deviations in the asymmetries of up to 20% relative to SPHINX (method b)). As was to be expected, the event generator predictions for the absolute cross sections differ significantly from the next-to-leading order QCD calculations. But fortunately the asymmetries show a much better agreement: relative deviations for prompt photon production for parameterizations with medium and large $\\Delta g(x,\\mu^2)$ barely exceed 10%.

Our study makes instead use of CP tags in order to build new asymmetries where the different parameters can be separated out. For this separation, it is decisive to achieve a good time resolution in the measurement of entangled state decays. Nevertheless, even with no temporal information, as would be the case in a symmetric factory, it is still possible to extract some information on the symmetries of the system.

We also study the consequences of neutrino energy averaging on the cross section and stress that in the 2-Majorana neutrino case this averaging leads to a suppression of the transverse neutrino polarization effects.","created":"2000-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":23,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino electron: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: magnetic moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: helicity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: transverse"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Dirac"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: energy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decoherence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":64,"citation_count":21,"authors":["Grimus, W.","Schwetz, T."]}

We discuss a model of this kind that arises naturally in the context of dynamically broken topcolor. There are many composite scalars in a theory of this kind. This has important effects on the Pagels-Stokar relation and the Higgs mass. We find $m_{\\rm Higgs} < 330$ GeV, lighter than in typical topcolor models.

{"title":"Symmetries and symmetry breaking","abstract":"Several new proton-proton parity violation experiments are presently either being performed or are being prepared for execution in the near future. Similarly, a new measurement of the parity-violating gamma-ray asymmetry in polarized neutron capture on the proton is being developed with a ten-fold improvement over previous measurements. These experiments are intended to provide stringent constraints on the set of seven effective weak meson-nucleon coupling constants. Time-reversal-invariance non-conservation has now been unequivocally demonstrated in a direct measurement at CPLEAR. Tests may also be made of time-reversal-invariance non-conservation in systems other than the kaon system. There exist two classes of time-reversal invariance breaking interactions: P-odd/T-odd and P-even/T-odd interactions. Constraints on the first ones stem from measurements of the electric dipole moment of the neutron, while constraints on the second ones stem from the same and measurements of charge symmetry breaking in neutron-proton elastic scattering and from $K$ semi-leptonic decays. A series of precision experiments, either ongoing or being prepared, will determine the neutral weak current of the proton by measuring the parity-violating normalized asymmetry in electron-proton elastic scattering. A direct comparison between the electromagnetic and neutral weak ground state currents of the nucleon will allow a delineation of the contributions to these currents of the various quark flavours, including quarks which belong exclusively to the nucleon sea. An extension of these precision experiments to very low momentum transfer would permit stringent limits to be placed on physics beyond the standard model.","created":"2000-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":11,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Taipei 2000/03/06"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon nucleon: weak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: one-meson"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"analyzing power"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson nucleon: coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time reversal: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor: neutral current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"experimental results"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":0,"authors":["van Oers, Willem T.H."]}

{"title":"Left-right symmetric heterotic string derived models","abstract":"Recently it was demonstrated that free fermionic heterotic-strings can produce models with solely the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model states in the low energy spectrum. This unprecedented result provides further strong evidence for the possibility that the true string vacuum shares some of the properties of the free fermionic models. Past free fermionic models have focused on several possible unbroken observable SO(10) subgroups at the string scale, which include the flipped SU(5) (FSU5), the Pati-Salam (PS) string models, and the string Standard-like Models (SLM). We extend this study to include the case in which the SO(10) symmetry is broken to the Left-Right Symmetric (LRS) gauge group, SO(10) -> SU(3)_C X U(1)_{B-L} X SU(2)_L X SU(2)_R. We present several models of this type and discuss their phenomenological features. The most striking new outcome of the LRS string models, in contrast to the case of the FSU5, the PS, and the SLM string models, is that they can produce effective field theories that are free of Abelian anomalies. We discuss the distinction between the two types of free fermionic models which result in the presence, or absence, of an anomalous U(1). As a counter example we also present a LRS model that does contain an anomalous U(1). Additionally, we discuss how in string models the Standard Model spectrum may arise from the three $\\mbf 16$ representations of SO(10), while the weak-hypercharge does not have the canonical SO(10) embedding.","created":"2000-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":43,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model: heterotic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SO(10)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: left-right"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"group theory: representation"}],"num_refs":49,"citation_count":111,"authors":["Cleaver, Gerald B.","Faraggi, Alon E.","Savage, Christopher"]}

{"title":"Flow equations in the light front QCD","abstract":"Flow equations method of continuous unitary transformations is used to eliminate the minimal quark-gluon interaction in the light-front quantized QCD Hamiltonian. The coupled differential equations in the two lowest Fock sectors correspond to the renormalization of the light-front gluon mass and the generation of effective quark-antiquark interaction. The influence of the renormalization of the gluon effective mass on the elimination of the quark-gluon coupling and the induced quark-antiquark interaction is taken into account. Namely, the original gauge field coupling can be completely eliminated, even when the states connected by this interaction are degenerate. Furthermore, even in the case where effective interaction, obtained within perturbative schemes (bound state perturbation theory or perturbative similarity approach), is not defined, we obtain more singular behavior $1/q^4$ at small gluon momenta. This is due to asymptotic behavior of the effective gluon mass at small cutoffs. By discussing the consequences of this asymptotic behavior, it seems that our approach is superior to perturbation theory and to perturbative similarity approach.","created":"2000-07-17T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Minneapolis 2000/05/12"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: light front"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Hamiltonian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: gap"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark antiquark: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential equations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transformation: unitarity"}],"num_refs":30,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Gubankova, Elena"]}

The source of color charge for this computation may be thought of as a crepe moving along the z axis at the speed of light. We refine the MV model by allowing for the presence of non-trivial longitudinal correlations between the color charges that comprise the nucleons. We find that a consistent treatment forces us to consider a pancake-like source which moves at slightly less than the speed of light.

While the virtual corrections are treated in DPA, the calculation of the bremsstrahlung corrections is based on the full lowest-order matrix elements to the processes e+ e- -> 4f+gamma. This asymmetric treatment of virtual and real photons requires a careful matching of the arising infrared and collinear singularities. We also take into account higher-order initial-state photon radiation via the structure-function method.

Domain walls with QCD scale internal structure form and coalesce obtaining Hubble size correlations and align nucleon spins. Due to strong CP violation, nucleons in these walls have anomalous electric and magnetic dipole moments and thus the walls are ferromagnetic. This induces electromagnetic fields with Hubble size correlations. The same CP violation also induces maximal helicity (Chern-Simons) correlated through the Hubble volume which supports an \"inverse cascade\" allowing the initial correlations to grow to 100 kpc today.

{"title":"Effective quark models in QCD at low and intermediate energies","abstract":"The effective quark models are employed to describe the hadronization of QCD in the quark sector. They reveal a different structure depending on how the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) is implemented. When the generation of light pseudoscalar mesons is manifestly incorporated one deals with an extension of the chiral quark model (CQM) with the non-linear realization of chiral symmetry. If a model is built at the CSB scale by means of perturbation theory it generalizes the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) one with chiral symmetry broken due to attractive 4-fermion forces in the scalar channel. The matching to high-energy QCD is realized at CSB scale by means of Chiral Sum Rules. Two types of models are compared in their fitting of meson physics. In particular, if the lowest scalar meson is sufficiently heavy approaching the mass of heavy \\pi'(1300) then QCD favours an effective theory which is dominated by the simplest CQM. On the contrary, the light scalar quarkonium with a mass of order 500MeV, supports the NJL mechanism.","created":"2000-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Guidel 2000/09/04"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Pushkin 2000/05/13"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: hadronization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Jona-Lasinio-Nambu model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sum rule: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bosonization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"current: correlation function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar meson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass formula"}],"num_refs":36,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Andrianov, Alexander A.","Andrianov, Vladimir A.","Espriu, D.","Tarrach, R."]}

{"title":"Neutrino oscillations in extended anti-GUT model","abstract":"What we call the Anti-GUT model is extended a bit to include also right-handed neutrinos and thus make use of the see-saw mechanism for neutrino masses. This model consists in assigning gauge quantum numbers to the known Weyl fermions and the three see-saw right-handed neutrinos. Each family (generation) is given its own Standard Model gauge fields and a gauge field coupled to the $B-L$ quantum number for that family alone. Further we assign a rather limited number of Higgs fields, so as to break these gauge groups down to the Standard Model gauge group and to fit, w.r.t. order of magnitude, the spectra and mixing angles of the quarks and leptons. We find a rather good fit, which for neutrino oscillations favours the small mixing angle MSW solution, although the mixing angle predicted is closest to the upper side of the uncertainty range for the measured solar neutrino mixing angle. An idea for making a ``finetuning''-principle to ``explain'' the large ratios found empirically in physics, and answer such questions as ``why is the weak scale low compared to the Planck scale?'', is proposed. A further very speculative extension is supposed to ``explain'' why we have three families.","created":"2000-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":40,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"neutrino mass"},{"source":"author","value":"neutrino oscillations"},{"source":"author","value":"grand unified theory"},{"source":"author","value":"SU(5) theory"},{"source":"author","value":"quark mass"},{"source":"author","value":"unified gauge models"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: San Juan 2000/05/01"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: family"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SU(5)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"group theory: representation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum number"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: Weyl"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"}],"num_refs":21,"citation_count":13,"authors":["Froggatt, C.D.","Nielsen, Holger Bech","Takanishi, Y."]}

{"title":"Mechanism for a next-to-lowest lying scalar meson nonet","abstract":"Recent work suggests the existence of a non-conventional lowest-lying scalar nonet containing the a 0 (980).

However a comparison of their properties with those expected on this basis reveals a number of puzzling features.

{"title":"Interacting quark model from bi-local soliton picture of baryon in two dimensions","abstract":"Two dimensional Quantum HadronDynamics is a bi-local gauge invariant reformulation of two dimensional QCD, introduced by one of us. The baryon arises as a topological soliton in this picture. Here we study the baryon number one sector of HadronDynamics. Starting from the soliton picture, we derive an interacting quark model, thus reconciling these two seemingly different approaches. The valence quark model arises as a variational approximation to HadronDynamics. We find a succession of better approximations to the soliton picture. The next simplest case that improves on the valence quark approximation turns out to correspond to a system of interacting valence, ���sea��� and anti-quarks. We also obtain this ���embellished��� quark model directly from the valence quark system through a Bogoliubov transformation. Using the solitonic point of view, we estimate the quark and anti-quark distributions of 2d QCD.

{"title":"Automatic Computation of LHC Processes","abstract":"Automatic computation is a new approach to HEP computing. The first suchsystems, GRACE [1], FeynArt/FeynCalc [2] and CompHEP [3], were reported at the1st International Workshop AIHENP held on March, 1990 in Lyon-Villeurbanne(France). Under this terminology, automatic computation system (ACS), we assume,as a distinguishing feature, the generation of the computing code for a specificcollision process with the aid of another code. ACS's are now used widely byphenomenologists for the calculation of many collision processes. For example,the GRACE and CompHEP systems were used in the LEP2 Workshop [4], and forevaluation of processes at TeV linear colliders [5]. With ACS one can calculateall collision processes within a given physical model, where by physical modelwe mean the set of Feynman rules. Recent developments with the LanHEP package[11] have opened a possibility to derive Feynman rules in the form of the ACSintrinsic physical model in a fully automatic way, starting from the Lagrangian.Now, not only the Standard Model but a number of its extensions, like SUSYmodels, are implemented in ACS. A general review of this new approach is givenin these Proceedings by K.Kato together with discussion of main directions ofthe ACS development. Here, we discuss in more detail specifics of the ACSapplications in LHC phenomenology, and in particular to the evaluation of QCDprocesses.

{"title":"NLO and NNLO Calculations","abstract":"1 The NLO and NNLO program QCD calculations of multijet rates beyond the leadingorder (LO) in the strong coupling constant �� s are usually quite involved.Nowadays we know (see Section 1.2) how to perform in general calculations of thenext-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to multijet rates, and almost everyprocess of interest has been computed to that accuracy. Instead, the calculationof the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) corrections is still at anorganizational stage and represents a main challenge. Why should we performcalculations which are technically so complicated ? The general motivation isthat the calculation of the NLO corrections allows us to estimate reliably agiven production rate, while the NNLO corrections allow us to estimate thetheoretical uncertainty on the production rate. This is achieved by reducing thedependence of the cross section on the renormalization scale, �� R , and forprocesses with strongly-interacting incoming particles the dependence on thefactorization scale, �� F , as well. An example is the determination of �� s fromevent shape variables in e + e ��� ��� 3 jets [1]. Although the NLO contributions toe + e ��� ��� 3 jets have been computed for some time now [2, 3], the NNLOcontributions have yet to be obtained. A calculation of these NNLO contributionswould be needed to further reduce the theoretical uncertainty in thedetermination of �� s.

{"title":"Jet Algorithms","abstract":"Jet algorithms have the task to assign streams of hadrons in hard scatteringprocesses to a jet, who's energy, mass and momentum can then be related to acollection of partons in a perturbative QCD calculation. Although, at theexperimental level, jets can be defined by using rather general and intuitiveprocedures, if we would like to compute jet cross sections and properties byusing QCD perturbation theory, the definition of jets should fulfil strongerconstraints to guarantee its perturbative safety. Perturbative safety means thatthe definition has to be infrared safe (jet properties cannot depend on thepresence of arbitrarily soft partons), collinear safe (jet properties cannotchange by replacing a parton with a set of collinear partons carrying the sametotal momentum) and collinearly factorizable (jet properties should beinsensitive to partons radiated collinearly to the beam direction). If the jetdefinition is not perturbative safe, we cannot perform calculations order-by-order in perturbation theory because they are affected by uncancelled infrareddivergences. Of course, in the full QCD theory (i.e. beyond perturbation theory)the perturbative divergences are regularized by small physical cutoffs relatedto hadron masses and the finite experimental resolution (size of calorimetercells, energy thresholds, etc.). The physical cutoffs are always present,independently of the jet definition. However, in the case of a perturbative safedefinition, their effects are suppressed by some inverse power of the jettransverse energy E T , and thus they can be made small by sufficientlyincreasing E T. This power suppression is not at work in perturbative unsafe jetdefinitions, where the effects of the small physical cutoffs can amount to largecorrections (of order unity) to the perturbative results. Thus, perturbativesafe definitions are preferred. Jet algorithms start from a list of \" particles\" which we would like to freely associate with calorimeter cells or hadrons atthe experimental level, and with partons in a QCD calculation. Each particle icarries a 4-momentum p �� i , which we take to be massless. The task is to selecta set of particles which are emitted close to each other in angle and combinetheir momenta to form the momentum of a jet. The selection process is called the\" jet algorithm \" , the momentum addition rule is called the \" recombinationscheme \". Let us start with a discussion of recombination schemes. In a hadroncollider environment the arbitrary boost of the hard scattering system along thebeam axis needs to be taken into account in the definition of angles to ensurecollinear factorizability.

{"title":"Isolated Photon Production","abstract":"When mentioning the photon in the framework of high-energy collider physics, oneis immediately led to think ��� with good reasons ��� to Higgs searches through thegold-plated channel H ��� ����. However, the production of photons also deservesattention on its own. Firstly, a detailed understanding of the continuum two-photon production is crucial in order to clearly disentangle any Higgs signalsfrom the background. Secondly, in hadronic collisions, where a very large numberof strong-interacting particles is produced, photon signals are relativelyclean, since the photon directly couples only to quarks. Therefore, prompt-photon data can be used to study the underlying parton dynamics, in acomplementary way with respect to analogous studies performed with hadrons orjets. For the same reason, these data represent a very important tool in thedetermination of the gluon density in the proton, g(x). Indeed, in recent yearsalmost all the direct information (that is, not obtained through scalingviolations as predicted by Altarelli-Parisi equations) on the intermediate-andhigh-x behaviour of g(x) came from prompt-photon production, pp ��� ��X and pN �����X, in fixed-target experiments. The main reason for this is that, at leadingorder, a photon in the final state is produced in the reactions qg ��� ��q and q ��q ��� ��g, with the contribution of the former subprocess being obviously sensitiveto the gluon and usually dominant over that of the latter. It is the 'point-like' coupling of the photon to the quark in these subprocesses that isresponsible for a much cleaner signal than, say, for the inclusive production ofa �� 0 , which proceeds necessarily through a fragmentation process. There is,however, a big flaw in the arguments given above. In fact, photons can also beproduced through a fragmentation process, in which a parton, scattered orproduced in a QCD reaction, fragments into a photon plus a number of hadrons.The problem with the fragmentation component in the prompt-photon reaction istwofold: first, it introduces in the cross section a dependence upon non-perturbative fragmentation functions, similar to those relevant in the case ofsingle-hadron production, which are not calculable in perturbative QCD and are,at present, very poorly determined by the sparse LEP data available. Secondly ,all QCD partonic reactions contribute to the fragmentation component; thus, when152","created":"2019-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":9,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"photon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"photon: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"scaling: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"gluon: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"fragmentation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"hadron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"quark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"fragmentation function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"inclusive production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"photon photon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"CERN LEP Stor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"background"}],"num_refs":13,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Frixione, S.","Vogelsang, W."]}

{"title":"Pattern formation in the early universe","abstract":"Systems that exhibit pattern formation are typically driven and dissipative. In the early universe, parametric resonance can drive explosive particle production called preheating. The fields that are populated then decay quantum mechanically if their particles are unstable. Thus, during preheating, a driven-dissipative system exists. We have shown previously that pattern formation can occur in two dimensions in a self-coupled inflaton system undergoing parametric resonance. In this paper, we provide evidence of pattern formation for more realistic initial conditions in both two and three dimensions. In the one-field case, we have the novel interpretation that these patterns can be thought of as a network of domain walls. We also show that the patterns are spatio-temporal, leading to a distinctive, but probably low-amplitude peak in the gravitational wave spectrum. In the context of a two-field model, we discuss putting power from resonance into patterns on cosmological scales, in particular to explain the observed excess power at 100 h^{-1}Mpc, but why this seems unlikely in the absence of a period of post-preheating inflation. Finally we note our model is similar to that of the decay of DCCs and therefore pattern formation may also occur at RHIC and LHC.","created":"1999-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":9,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: inflaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"resonance: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"domain wall"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"phi**n model: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitational radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"preheating"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boundary condition"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":54,"citation_count":7,"authors":["Sornborger, A.","Parry, M."]}

{"title":"Quasirotational motions and stability problem in dynamics of string hadron models","abstract":"For the relativistic string with massive ends (the meson model) and four various string baryon models (q-qq, q-q-q, Y and $\\Delta$) we consider the classical quasirotational motions, which are small disturbances of the planar uniform rotations of these systems. For the string meson model the two types of these solutions are obtained. They describe oscillatory motions in the form of stationary waves in the rotational plane and in the orthogonal direction. This approach and the suggested method of determining an arbitrary motion of the system on the base of initial data let us solve the stability problem for the rotational motions for all mentioned string configurations. It is shown that the classic rotational motions are {\\it stable} for the string meson model (or its analog q-qq) and for the $\\Delta$ baryon configuration, but they are {\\it unstable} for the string baryon models Y and q-q-q. For the latter two systems any small asymmetric disturbances grow with growing time. The motion of the q-q-q configuration become more complicated and quasiperiodic but quarks do not merge. In the case of Y model the evolution of disturbances results in falling a quark into the junction. These features of the classic behavior are important for describing the hadron states on the Regge trajectories and for choosing and developing the most adequate QCD-based string hadron models.","created":"2000-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":11,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"stability: rotation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: Regge poles"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model: linear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":30,"citation_count":23,"authors":["Sharov, G.S."]}

In the thesis, we improve the convergence of the perturbative series of the total cross section by choosing appropriate expansion parameters for both m_t and alpha_s. With these two prescriptions, the perturbative convergence is much improved. Correspondingly, the resulting ambiguity for the determination of m_t is estimated to be 0.1GeV. We also study the effect of all types of anomalous top-quark EDM interactions near the threshold for the first time. We show that one can disentangle these EDMs by the dependence of CP-odd observables on the CM-energy and on the degree of initial state polarization. The sensitivity to chromo-EDM at LC turns out to be better than that at LC in the open top region, but to be worse than that at LHC by a factor 1/10.

{"title":"Towards softer scales in hot QCD","abstract":"An effective theory for the soft field modes in hot QCD has been obtained recently by integrating out the field modes of momenta of order T and g T. The mean hard particle distribution obeys a transport equation with a collision term. The scale that comes out for the soft field is g^2 T ln 1/g . N-gluon soft amplitudes are shown to be a sum of tree diagrams and to obey tree-like Ward identities. These effective amplitudes are used to compute the one-soft loop contribution to the gluon self-energy when the loop momentum is of order g^2 T ln 1/g. It allows to identify a new collision term which, when included into the transport equation, takes into account collisions with gluon exchange of order g^2 T ln 1/g. The infrared behaviour of the collision term exhibits a significant change.","created":"2000-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vertex function: (3gluon)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Ward identity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator: renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"analytic properties"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transport theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: tensor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mean field approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: n-point function"}],"num_refs":25,"citation_count":6,"authors":["Guerin, F."]}

{"title":"Lepton number violation interactions and their effects on neutrino oscillation experiments","abstract":"Mixing between bosons that transform differently under the standard model gauge group, but identically under its unbroken subgroup, can induce interactions that violate the total lepton number. We discuss four-fermion operators that mediate lepton number violating neutrino interactions both in a model-independent framework and within supersymmetry (SUSY) without R-parity. The effective couplings of such operators are constrained by: i) the upper bounds on the relevant elementary couplings between the bosons and the fermions, ii) by the limit on universality violation in pion decays, iii) by the data on neutrinoless double beta decay and, iv) by loop-induced neutrino masses. We find that the present bounds imply that lepton number violating neutrino interactions are not relevant for the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems. Within SUSY without R-parity also the LSND anomaly cannot be explained by such interactions, but one cannot rule out an effect model-independently. Possible consequences for future terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments and for neutrinos from a supernova are discussed.","created":"2000-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: (4fermion)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"upper limit"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: (boson fermion)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"universality: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"double-beta decay: (0neutrino)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supernova"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"proposed experiment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":72,"citation_count":29,"authors":["Bergmann, Sven","Klapdor-Kleingrothaus, H.V.","Pas, Heinrich"]}

Domain walls with QCD scale internal structure form and coalesce obtaining Hubble scale correlations and align nucleon spins. Due to strong CP violation, nucleons in these walls have anomalous electric and magnetic dipole moments and thus the walls are ferromagnetic. This induces electromagnetic fields with Hubble size correlations. The same CP violation also induces a maximal helicity (Chern-Simons) correlated through the Hubble volume which supports an inverse cascade allowing the initial correlations to grow to 100 kpc today.

{"title":"Subleading Sudakov logarithms in electroweak high-energy processes to all orders","abstract":"In future collider experiments at the TeV scale, large logarithmic corrections originating from massive boson exchange can lead to significant corrections to observable cross sections. Recently double logarithms of the Sudakov-type were resummed for spontaneously broken gauge theories and found to exponentiate. In this paper we use the virtual contributions to the Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions to obtain the next to leading order kernel of the infrared evolution equation in the fixed angle scattering regime at high energies where particle masses can be neglected. In this regime the virtual corrections can be described by a generalized renormalization group equation with infrared singular anomalous dimensions. The results are valid for virtual electroweak corrections to fermions and transversely polarized vector bosons with an arbitrary number of external lines. The subleading terms are found to exponentiate as well and are related to external lines, allowing for a probabilistic interpretation in the massless limit. For $Z$-boson and $\\gamma$ final states our approach leads to exponentiation with respect to each amplitude containing the fields of the unbroken theory. For longitudinal degrees of freedom it is shown that the equivalence theorem can be used to obtain the correct double logarithmic asymptotics. At the subleading level, corrections to the would be Goldstone bosons contribute which should be considered separately. Explicit comparisons with existing one loop calculations are made.","created":"2000-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":26,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: scattering amplitude"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: Sudakov"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: nonabelian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"massless"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"DGLAP equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: transverse"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: polarized beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"positron: polarized beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":46,"citation_count":75,"authors":["Melles, Michael"]}

{"title":"The 'Recoil' correction of order (m alpha**6) to hyperfine splitting of positronium ground state","abstract":"The \"recoil\" correction of order $m \\alpha^6$ to the hyperfine splitting of positronium ground state was found. The formalism employed is based on the noncovariant perturbation theory in QED. Equation for two-particle component of full (many-body) wave function is used, in which effective Hamiltonian depends on the energy of a system. The effective Hamiltonian is not restricted to the nonrelativistic region, so there is no need in any regularization. To evaluate integrals over loop momenta, they are divided into \"hard\" and \"soft\" parts, coming from large and small momenta respectively. Soft contributions were found analytically, and hard ones are evaluated by numerical integration. Some soft terms due to the retardation cancel each other. To calculate the \"hard\" contributions, a great number of noncovariant graphs is replaced by only a few covariant ones. The hard contribution was found in two ways. The first way is to evaluate contributions of separate graphs, using the Coulomb gauge. The second one is to calculate full hard contribution as a whole using the Feynman gauge. The final result for the \"recoil\" correction is $0.381(6) m\\al^6$ and agrees with those of previous papers. Diagram-to-diagram comparison with the revised results of Adkins&Sapirstein was done. All the results agree, so the \"recoil\" correction is now firmly established.

The effects on the ordinary quark mixing are determined in terms of the quark masses and the parameters describing the mixing between the ordinary quarks q and the singlet quarks Q (q-Q mixing). Some salient features arise in the flavor changing interactions through the q-Q mixing. The unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix within the ordinary quark sector is violated, and the flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC's) appear both in the gauge and scalar couplings. The flavor changing interactions are calculated appropriately in terms of the q-Q mixing parameters and the quark masses, which really exhibit specific flavor structures. It is found that there are reasonable ranges of the model parameters to reproduce the ordinary quark mass hierarchy and the actual CKM structure even in the presence of q-Q mixing. Some phenomenological effects of the singlet quarks are also discussed. In particular, the scalar FCNC's may be more important in some cases, if the singlet quarks as well as the extra scalar particles from the singlet Higgs fields have masses $\\sim$ 100 GeV -- 1 TeV.","created":"2000-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":32,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark quark: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interaction: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: singlet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CKM matrix matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unitarity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":43,"citation_count":20,"authors":["Higuchi, Katsuichi","Yamamoto, Katsuji"]}

We discuss the ways of disentangling effects of physically different parameters of anomalies and estimate what magnitude of CP violating phenomena can be seen in these experiments.","created":"2000-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon photon: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon photon: fusion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon electron: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: polarized beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: polarized beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"helicity: amplitude analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular distribution: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"doublet: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon photon --> Higgs particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon electron --> Higgs particle electron"}],"num_refs":33,"citation_count":20,"authors":["Ginzburg, I.F.","Ivanov, I.P."]}

{"title":"Electroweak Bloch-Nordsieck violation at the TeV scale: 'Strong' weak interactions?","abstract":"Hard processes at the TeV scale exhibit enhanced (double log) EW corrections even for inclusive observables, leading to violation of the Bloch-Nordsieck theorem. This effect, previously related to the non abelian nature of free EW charges in the initial state (e- e+, e- p, p p ...), is here investigated for fermion initiated hard processes and to all orders in EW couplings. We find that the effect is important, especially for lepton initiated processes, producing weak effects that in some cases compete in magnitude with the strong ones. We show that this (double log) BN violating effect has a universal energy dependence, related to the Sudakov form factor in the adjoint representation. The role of this form factor is to suppress cross section differences within a weak isospin doublet, so that at very large energy the cross sections for left-handed electron-positron and neutrino-positron scattering become equal. Finally, we briefly discuss the phenomenological relevance of our results for future colliders.","created":"2000-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":18,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.15.-q"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.15.Lk"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Cy"},{"source":"author","value":"Bloch���Nordsieck violation"},{"source":"author","value":"Resummation of electroweak corrections"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion fermion: hard scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Bloch-Nordsieck theorem: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: coherent state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum electrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor: Sudakov"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"isospin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino positron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark antiquark: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"}],"num_refs":33,"citation_count":80,"authors":["Ciafaloni, Marcello","Ciafaloni, Paolo","Comelli, Denis"]}
{"title":"On the applicability of weak coupling results in high density QCD","abstract":"Quark matter at asymptotically high baryon chemical potential is in a color superconducting state characterized by a gap Delta. We demonstrate that although present weak-coupling calculations of Delta are formally correct for mu -> Infinity, the contributions which have to this point been neglected are large enough that present results can only be trusted for mu >> mu_c ~ 10^8 MeV. We make this argument by using the gauge dependence of the present calculation as a diagnostic tool. It is known that the present calculation yields a gauge invariant result for mu -> Infinity; we show, however, that the gauge dependence of this result only begins to decrease for mu > mu_c, and conclude that the result can certainly not be trusted for mu < mu_c. In an appendix, we set up the calculation of the influence of the Meissner effect on the magnitude of the gap. This contribution to Delta is, however, much smaller than the neglected contributions whose absence we detect via the resulting gauge dependence.","created":"2000-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":21,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density: high"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"superconductivity: gap"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: weak coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: chemical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dependence: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Meissner effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dyson-Schwinger equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":50,"citation_count":72,"authors":["Rajagopal, Krishna","Shuster, Eugene"]}

However the precise determination of $\\alpha_{n}$ in the very low energy region indicates that the polarizability of the neutron $\\alpha_{n}$ is around two order of magnitude smaller compared to what is expected in the phenomena in the MeV. region. We need another strong long range potential which decreases faster than $r^{-4}$. On the other hand, analysis of the low energy proton-proton data revealed the existence of the strong long range potential whose tail was $V(r) \\sim -C/r^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha=6.08$. The neuton-nucleus scattering is a good place to see such a force, since the strength $C$ is magnified by factor $A$, the mass number.

{"title":"Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the light front. 2. The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model","abstract":"An investigation of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the light front is made in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with one flavor and N colors. Analysis of the model suffers from extraordinary complexity due to the existence of a \"fermionic constraint,\" i.e., a constraint equation for the bad spinor component. However, to solve this constraint is of special importance. In classical theory, we can exactly solve it and then explicitly check the property of ``light-front chiral transformation.'' In quantum theory, we introduce a bilocal formulation to solve the fermionic constraint by the 1/N expansion. Systematic 1/N expansion of the fermion bilocal operator is realized by the boson expansion method. The leading (bilocal) fermionic constraint becomes a gap equation for a chiral condensate and thus if we choose a nontrivial solution of the gap equation, we are in the broken phase. As a result of the nonzero chiral condensate, we find unusual chiral transformation of fields and nonvanishing of the light-front chiral charge. A leading order eigenvalue equation for a single bosonic state is equivalent to a leading order fermion-antifermion bound-state equation. We analytically solve it for scalar and pseudoscalar mesons and obtain their light-cone wavefunctions and masses. All of the results are entirely consistent with those of our previous analysis on the chiral Yukawa model.","created":"2000-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":23,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Jona-Lasinio-Nambu model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 1"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light cone: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dynamical symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: constraint"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"condensation: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: bound state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"PCAC model"}],"num_refs":31,"citation_count":11,"authors":["Itakura, K.","Maedan, S."]}

We construct SU(7) and SU(8) GUTs where the effective lepton number violating couplings immediately evolve, while the baryon number non-conserving ones are safely projected out as the GUT symmetry breaks down to that of the MSSM. However at the next stage, when SUSY breaks, the radiative corrections shift the missing VEV components to some nonzero values of order M_{SUSY}, thereby inducing the ordinary Higgs doublet mass, on the one hand, and tiny baryon number violation, on the other. So, a missing VEV solution to the gauge hierarchy problem leads at the same time to a similar hierarchy of baryon vs lepton number violation.","created":"2000-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SU(7)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SU(8)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"family: 1"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"family: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"superpotential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hierarchy: gauge"}],"num_refs":49,"citation_count":3,"authors":["Chkareuli, J.L.","Froggatt, C.D."]}

{"title":"Effects of large CP phases on the proton lifetime in supersymmetric unification","abstract":"The effects of large CP violating phases arising from the soft SUSY breaking parameters on the proton lifetime are investigated in supersymmetric grand unified models. It is found that the CP violating phases can reduce as well as enhance the proton lifetime depending on the part of the parameter space one is in. Modifications of the proton lifetime by as much as a factor of 2 due to the effects of the CP violating phases are seen. The largest effects arise for the lightest sparticle spectrum in the dressing loop integrals and the effects decrease with the increasing scale of the sparticle masses. An analysis of the uncertainties in the determination of the proton life time due to uncertainties in the quark masses and in the other input data is also given.

Though the quark-hadron duality approach supports theoretically the factorized model, the two models exhibit a different behavior in the parton momentum fraction X at any fixed t. The relevant process to distinguish between the two options seems to be the WACS off the pion that measures (to leading t/s-order) the inverse moment <X^{-1}> of the skewed distribution.

{"title":"Neutrino masses and mixings from supersymmetry with bilinear R parity violation: A Theory for solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations","abstract":"The simplest unified extension of the MSSM with bi-linear R--Parity violation naturally predicts a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum, in which one neutrino acquires mass by mixing with neutralinos, while the other two get mass radiatively. We have performed a full one-loop calculation of the neutralino-neutrino mass matrix in the bi-linear \\rp MSSM, taking special care to achieve a manifestly gauge invariant calculation. Moreover we have performed the renormalization of the heaviest neutrino, needed in order to get meaningful results. The atmospheric mass scale and maximal mixing angle arise from tree-level physics, while solar neutrino scale and oscillations follow from calculable one-loop corrections. If universal supergravity assumptions are made on the soft-supersymmetry breaking terms then the atmospheric scale is calculable as a function of a single \\rp violating parameter by the renormalization group evolution due to the non-zero bottom quark Yukawa coupling. The solar neutrino problem must be accounted for by the small mixing angle (SMA) MSW solution. If these assumptions are relaxed then one can implement large mixing angle solutions, either MSW or just-so. The theory predicts the lightest supersymmetic particle (LSP) decay to be observable at high-energy colliders, despite the smallness of neutrino masses indicated by experiment.

{"title":"Collision induced decay of metastable baby skyrmions","abstract":"Many extensions of the standard model predict heavy metastable particles which may be modeled as solitons (skyrmions of the Higgs field), relating their particle number to a winding number. Previous work has shown that the electroweak interactions admit processes in which these solitons decay, violating standard model baryon number. We motivate the hypothesis that baryon-number-violating decay is a generic outcome of collisions between these heavy particles. We do so by exploring a 2+1 dimensional theory which also possesses metastable skyrmions. We use relaxation techniques to determine the size, shape and energy of static solitons in their ground state. These solitons could decay by quantum mechanical tunneling. Classically, they are metastable: only a finite excitation energy is required to induce their decay. We attempt to induce soliton decay in a classical simulation by colliding pairs of solitons. We analyze the collision of solitons with varying inherent stabilities and varying incident velocities and orientations. Our results suggest that winding-number violating decay is a generic outcome of collisions. All that is required is sufficient (not necessarily very large) incident velocity; no fine-tuning of initial conditions is required.","created":"2000-04-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":25,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Skyrmion: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"soliton: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"velocity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":31,"citation_count":5,"authors":["Dwyer, Daniel A.","Rajagopal, Krishna"]}

For large values of tan(beta) and a charged Higgs mass above the bound from b -> s gamma, we find that the branching fractions can be enhanced by up to an order of magnitude or suppressed by up to a factor of two compared to the Standard Model result. We point out that previous calculations in the literature are gauge-dependent due to the omission of an important diagram, which gives the dominant contribution in the 't Hooft-Feynman gauge.

The perturbative QCD calculation has been performed several times previously, at leading twist and at leading order in alpha_s, with mutually inconsistent results, even when the same light-cone distribution amplitudes have been employed. We have recalculated the helicity amplitudes for this process, using contour deformations to evaluate the singular integrals over the light-cone momentum fractions. We do not obtain complete agreement with any previous result. Our results are closest to those of the most recent previous computation, differing significantly for just one of the three independent helicity amplitudes, and only for backward scattering angles. We present results for the unpolarized cross section, and for three different polarization asymmetries. We compare the perturbative QCD predictions for these observables with those of the handbag and diquark models. In order to reduce uncertainties associated with alpha_s and the three-quark wave function normalization, we have normalized the Compton cross section using the proton elastic form factor.

{"title":"Relaxing near the critical point","abstract":"Critical slowing down of the relaxation of the order parameter is relevant both in early the universe and in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. We study the relaxation rate of the order parameter in an O(N) scalar theory near the critical point to model the non-equilibrium dynamics of critical fluctuations near the chiral phase transition.A lowest order perturbative calculation (two loops in the coupling lambda) reveals the breakdown of perturbation theory for long-wavelength fluctuations in the critical region and the emergence of a hierarchy of scales with hard q>T, semisoft T >> q >> lambda T and soft lambda T>>q loop momenta which are widely separated for weak coupling. The non-perturbative resummation in the large N limit reveals the renormalization of the interaction and the crossover to an effective 3D-theory for soft momenta.The effective 3D coupling goes to the Wilson-Fisher 3D fixed point in the soft limit.The relaxation rate of the order parameter for wave vectors lambda T >>k>> k_{us} or near the critical temperature lambda T>>m_T>>k_{us} with the ultra soft scale k_{us} = [(lambda T)/(4pi)] exp[-(4pi/lambda)] is dominated by classical semisoft loop momentum leading to Gamma(k,T) = lambda T/(2 pi N). For wavectors k<< k_{us} the damping rate is dominated by hard loop momenta and given by Gamma(k,T)=4 pi T/[3N ln(T/k)]. Analogously, for homogeneous fluctuations in the ultracritical region m_T<<k_{us} the damping rate is given by Gamma_0(m_T,T)=4 pi T/[3N ln(T/m_T)]. Thus critical slowing down emerges for ultrasoft fluctuations where the rate is lambda-independent.

The most important limits are those from searches for charginos, neutralinos and Higgs bosons at LEP, and searches for stop squarks, charginos and neutralinos at the Tevatron Collider. We also incorporate the constraints derived from b --> s + gamma decay, and discuss the relevance of charge- and colour-breaking minima in the effective potential. We combine and compare the different constraints on the Higgs-mixing parameter mu, the gaugino-mass parameter m_{1/2} and the scalar-mass parameter m0, incorporating radiative corrections to the physical particle masses. We focus on the resulting limitations on supersymmetric dark matter, assumed to be the lightest neutralino, incorporating coannihilation effects in the calculation of the relic abundance. We find that m_chi > 51 GeV and tan(beta) > 2.2 if all soft supersymmetry-breaking scalar masses are universal, including those of the Higgs bosons, and that these limits weaken to m_chi > 46 GeV and tan(beta) > 1.9 if non-universal scalar masses are allowed.

{"title":"Simplification of flavor combinatorics in evaluation of hadronic processes","abstract":"A serious computational problem in the evaluation of hadronic collision processes is connected with the large number of partonic subprocesses included in the calculation. These are from the quark and gluon content of the initial hadrons, and from CKM quark mixing. For example, there are 180 subprocesses which contribute to the $W$+2jets process, and 292 subprocesses in $W$+3jets production at the LHC, even when quarks from only the first two generations are taken into account. We propose a simple modification of the rules for evaluation of cross sections and distributions, which avoids multiplication of channels from the mixture of quark states. The method is based on a unitary rotation of down quarks, thus, transporting the mixing matrix elements from vertices of Feynman diagrams to the parton distribution functions (PDF). As a result, one can calculate cross sections with significantly fewer subprocesses. For the example mentioned above, with the new rules, one need evaluate only 21 and 33 subprocesses respectively. The matrix elements of the subprocesses are calculated without quark mixing but with a modified PDF convolution which depends on the quark mixing angle, and on the topologies of gauge invariant classes of diagrams.

The asymmetry requires observing the transverse momentum of the vector boson, but it is not suppressed by explicit inverse powers of a large energy scale. However, as we will show, inclusion of Sudakov factors causes suppression of the asymmetry, which increases with energy. Moreover, the asymmetry is shown to be approximately proportional to x_1 g_1(x_1) x_2 \\bar g_1(x_2), which gives rise to additional suppression at small values of the light cone momentum fractions. This implies that it is negligible for Z or W production and is mainly of interest for \\gamma^* at low energies.

The integrated semileptonic decay rate is calculated in two ways: first, by constructing the Operator Product Expansion, and second by a direct summation of the exclusive channels. Sum rules (Bjorken, Voloshin, etc.) for the potential model are derived, providing a possibility to compare the two representations for $\\Gamma(B\\to X_c l\\nu)$. An explicit difference between them referred to as duality-violation effect is found. The origin of this effect is related to higher charm resonances which are kinematically forbidden in the decay process but are nevertheless picked up by the OPE. Within the considered $1/m_c^2$ order the OPE and the sum over exclusive channels match each other, up to the contributions of higher resonances, by virtue of the sum rules. In particular this is true for the terms of order $\\delta m^2/m_c^2$ and $\\Lambda \\delta m/m_c^2$ which are present in each of the decay channels and cancel in the sum of these channels due to the Bjorken and Voloshin sum rules, respectively.

{"title":"Supersymmetric electroweak corrections to W+- H-+ associated production at the CERN Large Hadron Collider","abstract":"The $O(\\alpha_{ew}m_{t(b)}^{2}/m_{W}^{2})$ and $O(\\alpha_{ew} m_{t(b)}^4/m_W^4)$ supersymmetric electroweak corrections to the cross section for $W^{\\pm}H^{\\mp}$ associated production at the LHC are calculated in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Those corrections arise from the quantum effects which are induced by the Yukawa couplings from the Higgs sector and the genuine supersymmetric electroweak couplings involving supersymmetric particles, i.e. chargino-top(bottom)-sbottom(stop) couplings, neutralino-top(bottom)-stop(sbottom) couplings and charged Higgs-stop-sbottom couplings. The Yukawa corrections can decrease the total cross sections significantly for low $\\tan\\beta(<4)$ when $m_{H^+}<300$GeV, which exceed -12%. For high $\\tan\\beta$ the Yukawa corrections become negligibly small. The genuine supersymmetric electroweak corrections can increase or decrease the total cross sections depending on the supersymmetric parameters, which are at most a few percent, except the region near the threshold. We also show that the genuine supersymmetric electroweak corrections depend strongly on the choice of $\\tan\\beta$, $A_t$, $M_{\\tilde Q}$ and $\\mu$. For large values of $A_t$, or large values of $\\mu$ and $\\tan\\beta$, one can get larger corrections. The corrections can become very small, in contrast, for larger values of $M_{\\tilde Q}$.","created":"2000-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":47,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark antiquark: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon gluon: fusion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark quark: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: associated production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: CERN LHC Coll"}],"num_refs":38,"citation_count":25,"authors":["Yang, Ya-Sheng","Li, Chong-Sheng","Jin, Li-Gang","Zhu, Shou Hua"]}
{"title":"The Imprints of nonextensive statistical mechanics in high-energy collisions","abstract":"To describe high energy collisions one widely uses thermodynamical methods and concepts which follow the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) approach. In many cases, however, either some deviations from the expected behaviour are observed experimentally or it is known that the conditions necessary for BG to apply are satisfied only approximately. In other branches of physics where such situations are ubiquitous, the popular remedy is to resort, instead, to the so called nonextensive statistics, the most popular example of which is Tsallis statistics. We shall provide here an overview of possible imprints of non-extensitivity existing both in high energy cosmic ray physics and in multiparticle production processes in hadronic collisions, in particular in heavy ion collisions. Some novel proposition for the interpretation of the nonextensitivity parameter q present in such circumstances will be discussed in more detail.","created":"2000-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":23,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Denton 2000/04/03"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"statistical mechanics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"showers: cascade"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"multiple production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"entropy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fluctuation: measure"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":55,"citation_count":50,"authors":["Wilk, G.","Wlodarczyk, Z."]}

We address the question whether these fields can be coherent at large scales so that they may seed the galactic magnetic fields. Depending upon the mass of the charged scalar and upon various cosmological (critical fraction of energy density in matter, Hubble constant) and particle physics parameters we found that the magnetic fields generated in this way are much larger than vacuum fluctuations.

{"title":"Approximately selfconsistent resummations for the thermodynamics of the quark gluon plasma. 1. Entropy and density","abstract":"We propose a gauge-invariant and manifestly UV finite resummation of the physics of hard thermal/dense loops (HTL/HDL) in the thermodynamics of the quark-gluon plasma. The starting point is a simple, effectively one-loop expression for the entropy or the quark density which is derived from the fully self-consistent two-loop skeleton approximation to the free energy, but subject to further approximations, whose quality is tested in a scalar toy model. In contrast to the direct HTL/HDL-resummation of the one-loop free energy, in our approach both the leading-order (LO) and the next-to-leading order (NLO) effects of interactions are correctly reproduced and arise from kinematical regimes where the HTL/HDL are justifiable approximations. The LO effects are entirely due to the (asymptotic) thermal masses of the hard particles. The NLO ones receive contributions both from soft excitations, as described by the HTL/HDL propagators, and from corrections to the dispersion relation of the hard excitations, as given by HTL/HDL perturbation theory. The numerical evaluations of our final expressions show very good agreement with lattice data for zero-density QCD, for temperatures above twice the transition temperature.","created":"2000-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":66,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hard thermal loop"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"invariance: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"entropy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":68,"citation_count":352,"authors":["Blaizot, J.P.","Iancu, Edmond","Rebhan, A."]}

{"title":"Physics potential at a neutrino factory: Can we benefit from more than just detecting muons?","abstract":"In order to fully address the oscillation processes at a neutrino factory, a detector should be capable of identifying and measuring all three charged lepton flavors produced in charged current interactions {\\it and} of measuring their charges to discriminate the incoming neutrino helicity. This is an experimentally challenging task, given the required detector mass for long-baseline experiments. We address the benefit of a high-granularity, excellent-calorimetry non-magnetized target-detector, which provides a background-free identification of electron neutrino charged current and a kinematical selection of tau neutrino charged current interactions. We assume that charge discrimination is only available for muons reaching an external magnetized-Fe spectrometer. This allows the clean classification of events into electron, right-sign muon, wrong-sign muon and no-lepton categories. In addition, high granularity permits a clean detection of quasi-elastic events, which by detecting the final state proton, provide a selection of the neutrino electron helicity without the need of an electron charge measurement. From quantitative analyses of neutrino oscillation scenarios, we conclude that in many cases the discovery sensitivities and the measurements of the oscillation parameters are dominated by the ability to measure the muon charge. However, we identify cases where identification of electron and tau samples contributes significantly.","created":"2000-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":39,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"16.60.Pq"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.15.+g"},{"source":"author","value":"Neutrinos"},{"source":"author","value":"Oscillations"},{"source":"author","value":"Matter effects"},{"source":"author","value":"Neutrino factory"},{"source":"author","value":"CP violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino nucleon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charged current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/e"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/mu"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/tau"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: charge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: helicity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: spectrometer"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"kinematics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":37,"citation_count":117,"authors":["Bueno, A.","Campanelli, Mario","Rubbia, A."]}

{"title":"Discovery of proton decay: A Must for theory, a challenge for experiment","abstract":"It is noted that, but for one missing piece���proton decay���the evidence in support of grand unification is now strong. It includes: (i) the observed family-structure, (ii) the meeting of the gauge couplings, (iii) neutrino-oscillations, (iv) the intricate pattern of the masses and mixings of all fermions, including the neutrinos, and (v) the need for B���L as a generator, to implement baryogenesis. Taken together, these not only favor grand unification but in fact select out a particular route to such unification, based on the ideas of supersymmetry, SU(4)-color and left-right symmetry. Thus they point to the relevance of an effective string-unified G(224) or SO(10)-symmetry. A concrete proposal is presented, within a predictive SO(10)/G(224)-framework, that successfully describes the masses and mixings of all fermions, including the neutrinos���with eight predictions, all in agreement with observation. Within this framework, a systematic study of proton decay is carried out, which pays special attention to its dependence on the fermion masses, including the superheavy Majorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos. The study shows that a conservative upper limit on the proton lifetime is about (1/2���1)��1034���yrs, with ����K+ being the dominant decay mode, and as a distinctive feature, ��+K0 being prominent. This in turn strongly suggests that an improvement in the current sensitivity by a factor of five to ten (compared to SuperK) ought to reveal proton decay. Otherwise some promising and remarkably successful ideas on unification would suffer a major setback.","created":"2000-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":29,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"proton decay"},{"source":"author","value":"SU(4) theory"},{"source":"author","value":"colour model"},{"source":"author","value":"unified gauge models"},{"source":"author","value":"supersymmetry"},{"source":"author","value":"neutrino oscillations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Stony Brook 1999/09/23"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SO(10)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(4) x SU(2) x SU(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SU(5)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/tau: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":91,"citation_count":18,"authors":["Pati, Jogesh C."]}
{"title":"Constraints on a parity even / time reversal odd interaction","abstract":"Time-Reversal-Invariance non-conservation has for the first time been unequivocally demonstrated in a direct measurement, one of the results of the CPLEAR experiment. What is the situation then with regard to time-reversal-invariance non-conservation in systems other than the neutral kaon system? Two classes of tests of time-reversal-invariance need to be distinguished: the first one deals with parity violating (P-odd)/time-reversal-invariance non-conserving (T-odd) interactions, while the second one deals with P-even/T-odd interactions (assuming CPT conservation this implies C-conjugation non-conservation). Limits on a P-odd/T-odd interaction follow from measurements of the electric dipole moment of the neutron. This in turn provides a limit on a P-odd/T-odd pion-nucleon coupling constant which is 10^-4 times the weak interaction strength. Limits on a P-even/T-odd interaction are much less stringent. The better constraint stems also from the measurement of the electric dipole moment of the neutron. Of all the other tests, measurements of charge-symmetry breaking in neutron-proton elastic scattering provide the next better constraint. The latter experiments were performed at TRIUMF (at 477 and 347 MeV) and at IUCF (at 183 MeV). Weak decay experiments (the transverse polarization of the muon in K+ -> pi0 mu+ nu and the transverse polarization of the positrons in polarized muon decay) have the potential to provide comparable or possibly better constraints.","created":"2000-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"T invariance"},{"source":"author","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"source":"author","value":"kaon decay"},{"source":"author","value":"semileptonic decays"},{"source":"author","value":"neutron-proton interactions"},{"source":"author","value":"mass differences"},{"source":"author","value":"angular measurement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Adelaide 2000/03/13"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time reversal: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parity: conservation law"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p n: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"analyzing power"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon+: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K+: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"proposed experiment"}],"num_refs":17,"citation_count":0,"authors":["van Oers, Willem T.H."]}

{"title":"Uncertainty of predicted high Q**2 structure functions due to parametrization assumptions","abstract":"The HERA luminosity upgrade is expected to provide statistically significant measurements of the proton structure functions at 0.5<x<0.7 and very high Q2 (Q2>>M_{Z}^2). The behaviour of the parton densities (PDFs) in this high x, Q2 regime is predicted from DGLAP evolution of PDF parametrizations from lower Q2 fits of the data. Uncertainties in the PDFs at high x may propagate to lower x through DGLAP evolution at very high Q2. In this presentation the behaviour of the PDFs at high x is reexamined with different parametrizations that have been tried earlier, and with somewhat different constraints, set primarily by existing fixed target data. We present and discuss the effects at Q2=40000GeV^2 and compare our results with uncertainties obtained from propagation of experimental errors at high x, high Q2 DIS data.","created":"2000-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":3,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Liverpool 2000/04/25"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum transfer: high"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parametrization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"DGLAP equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":2,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Caldwell, A.","Paganis, S.","Sciulli, F."]}

High Q^2 and p^2_t processes measured at current and future colliders allow to improve our knowledge of Standard Model (SM) physics, by providing precise measurements of the SM parameters and, consequently, consistency checks of the SM. Moreover, they give information on key quantities for the calculation of the SM expectations in a yet unexplored domain, such as the parton densities of the proton or the photon. In addition to these experimental inputs, higher-order calculations are also needed to obtain precise expectations for SM processes, which are a key ingredient for the searches for new phenomena in high Q^2 and p^2_t processes at current and future experiments. The experimental and theoretical status of SM physics at high Q^2 and p^2_t is reviewed in the first part of this summary, with the remaining being dedicated to physics beyond the Standard Model.","created":"2000-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"conference summary"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Liverpool 2000/04/25"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charged current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum transfer: high"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: high"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: validity test"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: excited state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"four-fermion interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"leptoquark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":9,"citation_count":3,"authors":["Kuze, M.","Lola, S.","Perez, E.","Allanach, B."]}

In particular we discuss a quark mass definition which is a generalization of the static PS mass. The new definition allows us to calculate recoil corrections to the static PS mass. Using this result we calculate the cross section of e+e- -> t t-bar near threshold at NNLO accuracy adopting three alternative approaches, namely (1) fixing the pole mass, (2) fixing the PS mass, and (3) fixing the new mass which we call the PS-bar mass. We demonstrate that perturbative predictions for the cross section become much more stable if we use the PS or the PS-bar mass for the calculations. A careful analysis suggests that the top quark mass can be extracted from a threshold scan at NLC with an accuracy of about 100-200 MeV.","created":"2000-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":23,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Madison 2000/04/17"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"threshold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":63,"citation_count":5,"authors":["Yakovlev, Oleg I.","Groote, Stefan"]}

{"title":"Transition form-factors and widths of semileptonic decays of B and D mesons in the covariant light front dynamics","abstract":"Electroweak form factors for the decays of heavy B and D mesons are considered within the covariant formulation of light-front dynamics. With the aid of this approach, it is possible to separate the physical and unphysical contributions to the form factors. An analytic expression is obtained for gluon corrections to the electroweak vertex of the vector and the vector-axial quark current, and it is shown that, for constructing a quantitative description of available experimental data, it is important to take into account such corrections to the decay widths of heavy hadrons. The effect of contact interaction on the transition form factors is analyzed, and the importance of taking into account contact interaction for 0��� ��� 1��� transitions is demonstrated numerically. The elements |V bc|, |V bu|, |V cs|, and |tV cd| of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix are determined from an analysis of the entire body of data on 0��� ��� 0��� and 0��� ��� 1��� semileptonic decays.

{"title":"QCD at high parton density","abstract":"We discuss the physics of quarks and gluons in the nuclear wave function at very high energies. We show that the density of gluons and quarks in the nuclear structure functions can become very large as the energy of the nucleus increases. This leads to parton recombination in the nuclear wave function, which compensates the parton branching to keep the parton density from exceeding the maximum physically possible value. The effect is known as parton saturation. We derive an equation governing the structure functions in the saturation regime and present a solution of this equation. We will argue that eRHIC collider would be an ideal machine to study the strong gluonic fields associated with the saturation regime in the nucleus.","created":"2001-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":5,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Liverpool 2000/04/25"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"small-x"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Lipatov equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pomeron: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon nucleus: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parton: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: cascade"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: dipole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: Glauber"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Kovchegov, Yu.V."]}

Decay amplitudes are classified into the topologies of tree, penguin and annihilation, all of which contain both factorizable and nonfactorizable contributions. These contributions are expressed as the convolutions of hard $b$ quark decay amplitudes with universal meson wave functions. It is shown that (1) matrix elements of penguin operators are dynamically enhanced compared to those employed in the factorization assumption; (2) annihilation diagrams are not negligible, contrary to common belief; (3) annihilation diagrams contribute large strong phases; (4) the uncertainty of current data of the ratio $R={\\cal B}(B_d^0\\to K^\\pm\\pi^\\mp)/{\\cal B}(B^\\pm\\to K^0\\pi^\\pm)$ and of CP asymmetries is too large to give a constraint of $\\phi_3$.

In order to emphasize the essential point, the full spinor interaction is replaced by a model which includes only the Coulomb and the hyperfine interaction. By adjusting the effective quark masses, the only free parameters of the theory, the mass and the size of the pion are reproduced, as well as the mass of all other pseudo-scalar mesons. Estimates for the vector mesons are close to the empirical values. The model exposes screening rather than strict confinement. The ionization thresholds are in general much larger than the pion mass.","created":"2000-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Adelaide 1999/12/13"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: light cone"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Hamiltonian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark antiquark: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"regularization: dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"integral equations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: confinement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":16,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Pauli, Hans-Christian"]}

In all cases considered (compact U(1) in 3D and 4D, dual Abelian Higgs model) there are non-perturbative contributions associated with short distances which are due to topological defects. In QCD case, both classical and quantum effects determine the role of the topological defects and the theoretical analysis has not been completed so far. Generically, the topological defects would result in 1/Q^2 corrections going beyond the standard Operator Product Expansion.

{"title":"The East west effect for atmospheric neutrinos","abstract":"The atmospheric neutrino fluxes observed by underground detectors are not symmetric for rotations around the vertical axis. The flux is largest (smallest) for the nu's traveling toward east (west). This asymmetry is the result of the effects of the geomagnetic field on the primary cosmic rays and on their showers. The size of the asymmetry is to a good approximation independent from the existence of neutrino oscillations, and can in principle be predicted without any ambiguity due to existence of unknown new physics. We show that there is an interesting hint of discrepancy between the experimental measurement of the east-west asymmetry by Super-Kamiokande and the existing theoretical predictions. We argue that the discrepancy is a real effect caused by the neglect, in the existing calculations, of the bending of the charged secondary particles (in particular of the muons) in the cosmic ray showers. The inclusion of this effect in the calculation gives results in quantitative agreeement with the data.

{"title":"Random matrix theory and chiral symmetry in QCD","abstract":"Random matrix theory is a powerful way to describe universal correlations of eigenvalues of complex systems. It also may serve as a schematic model for disorder in quantum systems. In this review, we discuss both types of applications of chiral random matrix theory to the QCD partition function. We show that constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking determine the structure of low-energy effective partition functions for the Dirac spectrum. We thus derive exact results for the low-lying eigenvalues of the QCD Dirac operator. We argue that the statistical properties of these eigenvalues are universal and can be described by a random matrix theory with the global symmetries of the QCD partition function. The total number of such eigenvalues increases with the square root of the Euclidean four-volume. The spectral density for larger eigenvalues (but still well below a typical hadronic mass scale) also follows from the same low-energy effective partition function. The validity of the random matrix approach has been confirmed by many lattice QCD simulations in a wide parameter range. Stimulated by the success of the chiral random matrix theory in the description of universal properties of the Dirac eigenvalues, the random matrix model is extended to nonzero temperature and chemical potential. In this way we obtain qualitative results for the QCD phase diagram and the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator. We discuss the nature of the quenched approximation and analyze quenched Dirac spectra at nonzero baryon density in terms of an effective partition function. Relations with other fields are also discussed.","created":"2000-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":61,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matrix model: random"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partition function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: Dirac"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: chemical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: quenching"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":301,"citation_count":302,"authors":["Verbaarschot, J.J.M.","Wettig, T."]}

We develop theory of fermionic preheating coupling to the inflaton, without and with expansion of the universe, for light and massive fermions, to calculate analytically the occupation number of created fermions, focusing on their spectra and time evolution. In the case of large resonant parameter $q$ we extend for rermions the method of successive parabolic scattering, earlier developed for bosonic preheating. In an expanding universe parametric excitation of fermions is stochastic.

{"title":"Transverse dynamics of hard partons in nuclear media and the QCD dipole","abstract":"We derive the non-abelian generalization of the Furry approximation which describes the transverse dynamical evolution of a hard projectile parton inside a spatially extended colour target field. This provides a unified starting point for the target rest frame description of the nuclear dependence of a large class of observables. For the case of the virtual gamma -> q-qbar photoabsorption cross section, we investigate then in detail under which conditions the nuclear dependence encoded in the Furry wavefunctions can be parametrized by a q-qbar QCD dipole cross section. The important condition is colour triviality, i.e., the property that for arbitrary N-fold rescattering contributions the only non-vanishing colour trace is N_c C_F^N. We give proofs for the colour triviality of the inelastic, diffractive and total photoabsorption cross section measured inclusively or with one jet resolved in the final state. Also, we list examples for which colour interference effects remain. Colour triviality allows us to write the gamma -> q qbar contribution to the DIS nuclear structure function F_2 for small Bjorken x in terms of a path integral which describes the transverse size evolution of the q-qbar pair in the nuclear colour field. This expression reduces in an opacity expansion to the N=1 result of Nikolaev and Zakharov, and in the eikonal approximation to the Glauber-type rescattering formulas first derived by Mueller. In the harmonic oscillator approximation of the path integral, we quantify deviations from the eikonal limit. Their onset is characterized by the scales L/l_f and E_t L which relate the longitudinal extension L of the nuclear target to the coherence length l_f and the total transverse energy E_t accumulated by the q-qbar pair.","created":"2000-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":23,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Mh"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"24.85.+p"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"25.75.-q"},{"source":"author","value":"Colour dipole"},{"source":"author","value":"Furry approximation"},{"source":"author","value":"Colour triviality"},{"source":"author","value":"Opacity expansion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: dipole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: absorption"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: off-shell"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: nonabelian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"multiple scattering: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"two-point function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: interference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"path integral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: eikonal"}],"num_refs":40,"citation_count":94,"authors":["Wiedemann, Urs Achim"]}

However, the results in the most interesting case of production of massive fermions in an expanding Universe were so far known only numerically. We provide very simple and readable analytical formulae, both for the spectra of the created fermions and for their total energy density. Their derivation is closely related to the one adopted for bosons and exploits the fact that the production occurs during very short intervals of nonadiabatical change of the fermionic frequency. Our formulae show the presence of resonance bands if the expansion of the Universe is neglected, and their disappearance when the latter is included. As in the bosonic case, this last effect is due to the stochastic character that the expansion gives to the whole process. Backreaction is considered in the last part of the work. All our analytical results are in excellent agreement with the previous numerical ones in the regime of validity of the latter. However, a more accurate scaling for the energy density of the produced fermions is here found.","created":"2000-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":21,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation: chaos"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: massive"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"preheating"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"back reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":35,"citation_count":97,"authors":["Peloso, Marco","Sorbo, Lorenzo"]}

When a scalar in the adjoint representation is exchanged in the reaction $A+A \\to A+A$, the usual most attractive channel (MAC) rule is reversed in sign, with the consequence that the formation of a condensate with the largest possible Casimir is favored. More generally, when a scalar in a general representation is exchanged in the reaction $A+B \\to B+A$, the group theoretic sum giving the force sign and strength can be expressed in terms of a Racah coefficient for the group in question. We illustrate the formalism in the case of the group SU(2), and give possible applications to SO(10) and $E_6$ grand unification.","created":"2000-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"force"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"group theory: representation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SO(10)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: E(6)"}],"num_refs":8,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Adler, Stephen L."]}

The effects of this lepton mixing are, however, suppressed naturally by the hierarchy of the charged lepton masses. In the supersymmetric model, significant effects of lepton flavor violation may appear rather through slepton mixing, which is in the present case generated by radiative corrections with ordinary-exotic lepton couplings. We are especially interested in the mu -> e gamma decay. In the model without the bare mass term of vectorlike leptons, the supersymmetric contributions are rather suppressed due to the approximate U(1)_e X U(1)_mu. It is, however, remarkable that they are substantially enhanced by tan^6 beta. Then, B(mu -> e gamma) might be comparable to the experimental bound for large tan beta. In the model with the bare mass term, much larger contributions are obtained through slepton mixing. These investigations show that the supersymmetric effects on lepton flavor violation due to the vectorlike leptons can be observed in the near future experiments.","created":"2000-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: E(6)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: vector"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"slepton: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":19,"citation_count":12,"authors":["Kitano, Ryuichiro","Yamamoto, Katsuji"]}

{"title":"Neutrino proper time?","abstract":"An electron neutrino can have the quantum phase of an electron, i.e. share its internal clock, if the neutrino takes a path in space-time that is not in the direction of its energy-momentum. Each flavor neutrino would then have a different internal clock; a muon neutrino would have a muon clock and a tau neutrino would have a tau clock. Perhaps surprisingly, there is some evidence suggesting neutrinos have such clocks. If muon neutrinos travel on space-like paths then some atmospheric muon neutrinos would take such paths backwards into outer space and not be observed. These are lost at the source and have nothing to do with oscillations or flavor-changing in flight. The expected depletion of source muon neutrinos is shown here to be 9%, which accounts for half of the missing muon neutrino source flux reported by Super-Kamiokande. Since there is no depletion in the electron neutrino flux source reported at SK and SN1987A electron neutrinos seem to have traveled at the speed of light, the electron neutrino travels on a light-like path.

Within the considered parameter space, the enhancement to the ratio $BR(b \\to s g)$ due to the charged-Higgs penguins can be as large as a factor of 8 (3) in the model III (II), while the ratio $BR(b \\to no charm)$ can be increased from the standard model prediction of 2.49% to 4.91% (2.99%) in the model III (II). Consequently, the value of $B_{SL}$ and $n_c$ can be decreased simultaneously in the model III. The central value of $B_{SL}$ will be lowered slightly by about 0.003, but the ratio $n_c$ can be reduced significantly from the theoretical prediction of $n_c= 1.28 \\pm 0.05$ in the SM to $n_c= 1.23 \\pm 0.05$, $1.18 \\pm 0.05$ for $m_{H^+}=200, 100$ GeV, respectively.

We discuss how these textures can be realized in supersymmetric grand unified models with horizontal symmetry SU(3) H among the fermion generations. In this framework the mass and mixing hierarchy of fermions (including neutrinos) can emerge in a natural way. We emphasize the central role played by the SU(3) H adjoint Higgs field which reduces SU(3) H to U(2) H at the GUT scale. A complete SO(10)��SU(3) H model is presented in which the desired Yukawa textures can be obtained by symmetry reasons. The phenomenological implications of these textures are thoroughly investigated. Among various realistic possibilities for the Clebsch factors between the quark and lepton entries, we find three different solutions which provide excellent fits of the quark masses and CKM mixing angles. Interestingly, all these solutions predict the correct amount of CP violation via the CKM mechanism, and, in addition, lead to an appealing pattern of the neutrino masses and mixing angles. In particular, they all predict nearly maximal 23 mixing and small 12 mixing in the lepton sector, respectively, in the range needed for the explanation of the atmospheric and solar neutrino anomaly.","created":"2000-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":49,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SU(5)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"horizontal symmetry: SU(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: texture"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CKM matrix matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SO(10)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":91,"citation_count":102,"authors":["Berezhiani, Zurab","Rossi, Anna"]}

In this framework, we show that, in the presence of large SUSY phases, the bounds on the Electric Dipole Moments can be controled without fine-tuning.

Duality occurs thanks to a new sum rule which expresses the subleading HQET form factor $\\xi_3$ or, in other notations, $a_+^{(1)}$ in terms of the infinite mass limit form factors and some level splittings. We also demonstrate the sum rule, which is not restricted to the condition $m_b-m_c \\ll m_b$, applying OPE to the longitudinal axial component of the hadronic tensor without neglecting the $1/m_b$ subleading contributions to the form factors. We argue that this method should produce a new class of sum rules, depending on the current, beyond Bjorken, Voloshin and the known tower of higher moments. Applying OPE to the vector currents we find another derivation of the Voloshin sum rule. From independent results on $\\xi_3$ we derive a sum rule which involves only the $\\tau_{1/2}^{(n)}$ and $\\tau_{3/2}^{(n)}$ form factors and the corresponding level splittings. The latter strongly supports a theoretical evidence that the $B$ semileptonic decay into narrow orbitally-excited resonances dominates over the decay into the broad ones, in apparent contradiction with some recent experiments.

Estimating the light-quark admixture by meson mixing, we obtain a reasonable description of the branching ratios for these processes.","created":"2000-03-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charmonium"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quarkonium: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pseudoscalar meson"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"J/psi(3100)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"psi(3685)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"eta/c(2980)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Fock space"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quarkonium: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quarkonium: electromagnetic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"amplitude analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":62,"citation_count":51,"authors":["Feldmann, Thorsten","Kroll, Peter"]}

{"title":"The Asymptotic regime of high density QCD","abstract":"We discuss the distinct approaches for high density QCD (hdQCD) in the asymptotic regime of large values of parton density. We derive the AGL equation for running coupling constant and obtain the asymptotic solution, demonstrating that the property of partial saturation of the solution of the AGL equation is not modified by the running of the coupling constant. We show that in this kinematical regime, the solution of the AGL equation coincides with the solution of an evolution equation, obtained recently using the McLerran-Venugopalan approach. Using the asymptotic behavior of the gluon distribution we calculate the $F_2$ structure function assuming first that the leading twist relation between these two quantities is valid and second that this relation is modified by the higher twist terms associated to the unitarity corrections. In the first case we obtain that the corresponding $F_2$ structure function is linearly proportional to $ln s$, which agrees with the results obtained recently by Kovchegov using a distinct approach. In the second case a softer behavior is obtained. In both cases, the $F_2$ structure function unitarizes and the Froissart boundary is not violated in the asymptotic regime of high density QCD. We conclude that the partial saturation of the gluon distribution and the unitarization of the structure function are general results, well-established by three distinct approaches for high dense systems.","created":"2000-03-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: small-x"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unitarity: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction: coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"asymptotic behavior"}],"num_refs":42,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Gay Ducati, M.B.","Goncalves, V.P."]}

For the case of the quantum roll we map out the domain of validity of the large-N expansion.

If octet processes turn out important the recently suggested lightest J^{PC}=0^{++} glueball with mass around 1000 MeV should become visible already in the spectrum of the leading charged particle pairs.","created":"2000-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":11,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: fragmentation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: jet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glueball: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: hybrid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron spectroscopy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: singlet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: octet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rapidity: gap"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: jet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: leading particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"}],"num_refs":35,"citation_count":27,"authors":["Minkowski, Peter","Ochs, Wolfgang"]}

The electroweak scale is generated by a ``warp'' factor of the induced metric on the brane where the standard model fields live. However, it is not necessary to confine the standard model fields on the brane and we analyze the possibility of having the fields actually living in the slice of AdS. Specifically, we study the behaviour of fermions, gauge bosons and scalars in this geometry and their implications on electroweak physics. These scenarios can provide an explanation of the fermion mass hierarchy by warp factors. We also consider the case of supersymmetry in the bulk, and analyze the conditions on the mass spectrum. Finally, a model is proposed where the warp factor generates a small (TeV) supersymmetry-breaking scale, with the gauge interactions mediating the breaking to the scalar sector.","created":"2000-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: anti-de Sitter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: higher-dimensional"}],"num_refs":44,"citation_count":1225,"authors":["Gherghetta, Tony","Pomarol, Alex"]}

This region is affected both by non-perturbative phenomena related to the Fermi motion of the heavy quark and by perturbative soft gluon radiation in the final state (Sudakov form factor).Fermi motion can be described by the shape function f (m*), which represents the distribution of the effective mass m* of the heavy quark at disintegration time. We perform a factorization with a simple technique in order to consistently separate perturbative from non-perturbative effects. We find that the shape function, contrary to naive expectations,is not a physical distribution, as it is affected by substantial regularization scheme effects, controlling even the leading, double-logarithmic term. It factorizes, however, the bulk of non-perturbative effects in lattice-like regularizations. Some non-perturbative effects are present in the coefficient function even at leading twist, but they are expected to be suppressed on physical grounds.

{"title":"Report of the SUGRA Working Group for run II of the Tevatron","abstract":"We present an analysis of the discovery reach for supersymmetric particles at the upgraded Tevatron collider, assuming that SUSY breaking results in universal soft breaking parameters at the grand unification scale, and that the lightest supersymmetric particle is stable and neutral. We first present a review of the literature, including the issues of unification, renormalization group evolution of the supersymmetry breaking parameters and the effect of radiative corrections on the effective low energy couplings and masses of the theory. We consider the experimental bounds coming from direct searches and those arising indirectly from precision data, cosmology and the requirement of vacuum stability. The issues of flavor and CP-violation are also addressed. The main subject of this study is to update sparticle production cross sections, make improved estimates of backgrounds, delineate the discovery reach in the supergravity framework, and examine how this might vary when assumptions about universality of soft breaking parameters are relaxed. With 30 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity and one detector, charginos and neutralinos, as well as third generation squarks, can be seen if their masses are not larger than 200-250 GeV, while first and second generation squarks and gluinos can be discovered if their masses do not significantly exceed 400 GeV. We conclude that there are important and exciting physics opportunities at the Tevatron collider, which will be significantly enhanced by continued Tevatron operation beyond the first phase of Run II.","created":"2000-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":173,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supergravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: oblique"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: validity test"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics: missing-mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: magnetic moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"counters and detectors"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Batavia TEVATRON Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"2000 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":563,"citation_count":237,"authors":["Barger, V.","Kamon, T.","Flattum, E.","Falk, T.","Abel, S.","Accomando, E.","Anderson, G.","Arnowitt, R.","Azzi, P.","Baer, H.","Bagger, J.","Beenakker, W.","Belyaev, A.","Berger, E.","Berger, M.","Brhlik, M.","Blazek, T.","Blessing, S.","Bokhari, W.","Bruner, N.","Carena, M.","Chakraborty, D.","Chang, D.","Chankowski, P.","Chen, C.H.","Cheng, H.C.","Chertok, M.","Cho, G.C.","Claes, D.","Demina, R.","Done, J.","Duflot, L.","Dutta, Bhaskar","Eboli, O.J.P.","Eno, S.","Feng, J.","Ganis, G.","Gold, M.","Gregores, E.M.","Hagiwara, K.","Han, T.","Harris, B.","Hikasa, K.","Holck, C.","Kao, C.","Kato, Y.","Klasen, M.","Keung, W.Y.","Kramer, M.","Lammel, S.","Li, T.J.","Lykken, J.D.","Magro, M.","Mani, S.","Matchev, K.T.","Mangano, M.","Mercadante, P.","Mrenna, S.","Nachtman, J.","Nath, P.","Nojiri, M.M.","Nomerotski, A.","Norman, D.","Oishi, R.","Ono, K.","Paige, F.","Paterno, M.","Parke, S.","Pierce, D.","Pilaftsis, A.","Plehn, T.","Pompos, A.","Polonksy, N.","Pokorski, S.","Quintana, P.","Roco, M.","Saltzberg, D.","Savoy-Navarro, A.","Seiya, Y.","Smith, C.","Spira, M.","Spiropulu, M.","Sullivan, Z.","Szalapski, R.","Tannenbaum, B.","Tait, T.","Wackeroth, D.","Wang, Y.","White, J.","Williams, H.H.","Worcester, M.","Worm, S.","Zhang, R.J.","Zielinski, M."]}

We find that the SMA solution gives the best fit to the total rates data from the different experiments. One new feature of our analysis is the use of the moments of the SK electron spectrum in a $\\chi^2$ analysis. The best-fit to the moments is broadly in agreement with that obtained from a direct fit to the spectrum data and prefers a $\\Delta m^2$ comparable to the SMA fit to the rates but the required mixing angle is larger.

This term adds a contribution to the low energy theory of gravity which does not need to affect the cosmology but which is necessary for the surface of the vacuum bubble to recover four dimensional gravity.","created":"2000-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: anti-de Sitter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"any-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boundary condition"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state: bubble"}],"num_refs":26,"citation_count":153,"authors":["Collins, Hael","Holdom, Bob"]}

{"title":"Perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of moments of the thrust distribution in e+ e- annihilation","abstract":"Resummation and power-corrections play a crucial role in the phenomenology of event-shape variables like the thrust T. Previous investigations showed that the perturbative contribution to the average thrust is dominated by gluons of small invariant mass, of the order of 10% of Q, where Q is the center-of-mass energy. The effect of soft gluons is also important, leading to a non-perturbative 1/Q correction. These conclusions are based on renormalon analysis in the single dressed gluon (SDG) approximation. Here we analyze higher moments of the thrust distribution using a similar technique. We find that the characteristic gluon invariant mass contributing to <(1-T)^m> increases with m. Yet, for m=2 this scale is quite low, around 27% of Q, and therefore renormalon resummation is still very important. On the other hand, the power-correction to <(1-T)^2> from a single soft gluon emission is found to be highly suppressed: it scales as 1/Q^3. In practice, <(1-T)^2> and higher moments depend also on soft gluon emission from configurations of three hard partons, which may lead to alpha_s(Q^2)/Q power-corrections. This issue is yet to be investigated.","created":"2000-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":26,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"event shape analysis: moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"regularization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization: renormalon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: thrust"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: emission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"asymptotic expansion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":29,"citation_count":43,"authors":["Gardi, Einan"]}
{"title":"Renormalization group improved effective potential for the MSSM Higgs sector with explicit CP violation","abstract":"We perform a systematic study of the one-loop renormalization-group-improved effective potential of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), including CP violation induced radiatively by soft trilinear interactions related to squarks of the third generation. We calculate the charged and neutral Higgs-boson masses and couplings, including the two-loop logarithmic corrections that arise from QCD effects, as well as those associated with the top- and bottom-quark Yukawa couplings. We also include the potentially large two-loop non-logarithmic corrections induced by one-loop threshold effects on the top- and bottom-quark Yukawa couplings, due to the decoupling of the third-generation squarks. Within this minimal CP-violating framework, the charged and neutral Higgs sectors become intimately related to one another and therefore require a unified treatment. In the limit of a large charged Higgs-boson mass, M_{H^+} >> M_Z, the lightest neutral Higgs boson resembles that in the Standard Model (SM), and CP violation occurs only in the heavy Higgs sector. Our analysis shows that sizeable radiative effects of CP violation in the Higgs sector of the MSSM may lead to significant modifications of previous studies for Higgs-boson searches at LEP2, the Tevatron and the LHC. In particular, CP violation could enable a relatively light Higgs boson to escape detection at LEP2.","created":"2000-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":52,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: decoupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":165,"citation_count":367,"authors":["Carena, Marcela","Ellis, John R.","Pilaftsis, A.","Wagner, C.E.M."]}

We also consider string models which allow for nonuniversality of gaugino masses and D brane models where nonuniversality arises from embeddings of the Standard Model gauge group on five branes and nine branes. It is found that with gaugino mass nonuniversality the range of the LSP mass can be extended much beyond the range allowed in the universal SUGRA case, up to about 600 GeV even without coannihilation effects in some regions of the parameter space. The effects of coannihilation are not considered and inclusion of these effects may further increase the allowed neutralino mass range. Similarly with the inclusion of gaugino mass nonuniversality, the neutralino-proton ($\\chi -p$) cross-section can increase by as much as a factor of 10 in some of regions of the parameter space.

Examples are provided by domination by a kinetic mode of a scalar field, which may be both the inflaton and the late time `quintessence', and also by more conventional models of reheating. The resultant modification to the pre-nucleosynthesis expansion rate can allow solely an asymmetry in right handed electrons to produce a net baryon asymmetry when reprocessed by the anomalous B+L violating processes of the standard model. The production of such a source asymmetry - what we term `electrogenesis' - requires no additional B or L violation beyond that in the standard model. We consider a specific model for its generation, by a simple perturbative out of equilibrium decay of Higgs like scalar fields with CP-violating Yukawa couplings to the standard model leptons. We show that, because of the much enhanced expansion rate, such a mechanism can easily produce an adequate asymmetry from scalars with masses as low as 1 TeV. Kinetic mode domination is strongly favoured because it evades large entropy release which dilutes the asymmetry.

{"title":"NonFermi liquid behavior, the BRST identity in the dense quark gluon plasma and color superconductivity","abstract":"At sufficiently high baryon densities, the physics of a dense quark-gluon plasma may be investigated through the tools of perturbative QCD. This approach has recently been successfully applied to the study of color superconductivity, where the dominant di-quark pairing interaction arises from one gluon exchange. Screening in the plasma leads to novel behaviour, including a remarkable non-BCS scaling of T_C, the transition temperature to the color superconducting phase. Radiative corrections to one gluon exchange were previously considered and found to affect T_C. In particular, the quark self-energy in a plasma leads to non-Fermi liquid behaviour and suppresses T_C. However, at the same time, the quark-gluon vertex was shown not to modify the result at leading order. This dichotomy between the effects of the radiative corrections at first appears rather surprising, as the BRST identity connects the self-energy to the vertex corrections. Nevertheless, as we demonstrate, there is in fact no contradiction with the BRST identity, at least to leading log order. This clarifies some of the previous statements on the importance of the higher order corrections to the determination of T_C and the zero temperature gap in color superconductivity.","created":"2000-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":21,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: superconductivity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"diquark: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator: renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: liquid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"invariance: Becchi-Rouet-Stora"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vertex function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Ward identity"}],"num_refs":25,"citation_count":102,"authors":["Brown, William E.","Liu, James T.","Ren, Hai-cang"]}

We show that for any specific oscillation pattern $m_{ee}$ can take any value (from zero to the existing upper bound) for normal mass hierarchy and it can have a minimum for inverse hierarchy. This means that oscillation experiments cannot fix in general $m_{ee}$. Mass ranges for $m_{ee}$ can be predicted in terms of oscillation parameters with additional assumptions about the level of degeneracy and the type of hierarchy of the neutrino mass spectrum. These predictions for $m_{ee}$ are systematically studied in the specific schemes of neutrino mass and flavor which explain the solar and atmospheric neutrino data. The contributions from individual mass eigenstates in terms of oscillation parameters have been quantified. We study the dependence of $m_{ee}$ on the non-oscillation parameters: the overall scale of the neutrino mass and the relative mass phases. We analyze how forthcoming oscillation experiments will improve the predictions for $m_{ee}$. On the basis of these studies we evaluate the discovery potential of future \\znbb decay searches. The role \\znbb decay searches will play in the reconstruction of the neutrino mass spectrum is clarified.

The solution is achieved by including three trilinear R-parity violating operators in the superpotential. The soft supersymmetry breaking terms satisfy renormalisation group invariant relations in terms of supersymmetric couplings and the overall supersymmetry breaking mass scale. Flavour changing neutral currents can be naturally highly suppressed. A specific model predicts tan beta=4.2+/-1.0. Excluding sleptons, the supersymmetric particle spectrum then depends upon two remaining free parameters. In the case of the R-parity violating couplings set at their quasi-fixed points at a supersymmetric GUT scale, the whole sparticle spectrum approximately depends upon only one free parameter. Imposing experimental limits leads to a constrained and distinctive phenomenology. The lightest CP-even Higgs of mass m_h=118 GeV would be seen at the Tevatron. All sparticles and heavy Higgs would evade detection except for the lightest charginos and neutralinos, whose distinctive leptonic decays would be seen at the LHC.","created":"2000-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":16,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anomaly"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"slepton: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group: beta function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":28,"citation_count":76,"authors":["Allanach, B.C.","Dedes, A."]}

In this model, the supergravity (SUGRA) and gauge mediated (GM) contributions to MSSM scalar and gaugino masses are comparable - this enables a realistic spectrum to be attained since GM contribution to the right-handed (RH) slepton (mass)^2 by itself (i.e., neglecting SUGRA contribution to sfermion {\\em and} gaugino masses) is negative.

With MSSM matter and SUSY breaking fields localized on separate branes in an extra dimension of size R \\sim 5 M^{-1}_{Pl} (in which gauge fields propagate), the SUGRA contribution to sfermion masses (which violates flavor) is suppressed. As in 4 dimensions, MSSM gauginos acquire {\\em non}-universal masses from both SUGRA and GM - gaugino masses (in particular the SUGRA contribution to gaugino masses), in turn, generate acceptable sfermion masses through RG evolution; the phenomenology is discussed briefly.

The basic point of this joint construction is the \"dipole spectral relation\" emerging from axioms of local QFT.

{"title":"Pursuing the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking: A 'Bayesian physics' argument for a s**(1/2) <= 600-GeV e+ e- collider","abstract":"High-energy data has been accumulating over the last ten years, and it should not be ignored when making decisions about the future experimental program. In particular, we argue that the electroweak data collected at LEP, SLC and Tevatron indicate a light scalar particle with mass less than 500 GeV. This result is based on considering a wide variety of theories including the Standard Model, supersymmetry, large extra dimensions, and composite models. We argue that a high luminosity, 600 GeV e+e- collider would then be the natural choice to feel confident about finding and studying states connected to electroweak symmetry breaking. We also argue from the data that worrying about resonances at multi-TeV energies as the only signal for electroweak symmetry breaking is not as important a discovery issue for the next generation of colliders. Such concerns should perhaps be replaced with more relevant discovery issues such as a Higgs boson that decays invisibly, and ``new physics'' that could conspire with a heavier Higgs boson to accommodate precision electroweak data. An e+e- collider with energy less than about 600 GeV is ideally suited to cover these possibilities.","created":"2000-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":21,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Berkeley 2000/03/29"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: colliding beams"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: validity test"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"new interaction: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":44,"citation_count":8,"authors":["Kane, Gordon L.","Wells, James D."]}

Various features of the model which gives remarkably accurate results for the quark and lepton masses and mixings were presented earlier in separate publications. The construction of the matrices is first discussed in the framework of effective operators, from which one naturally obtains the maximal \\nu_\\mu - \\nu_\\tau mixing, while the small angle or maximal mixing solutions for the solar neutrinos depend upon the nature of the Majorana matrix. A set of Higgs and fermion superfields is then introduced from which the Higgs and Yukawa superpotentials uniquely give the structure of the mass matrices previously obtained. The right-handed Majorana matrix arises from one Higgs field coupling to several pairs of superheavy conjugate neutrino singlets. For the simple version considered, 10 input parameters accurately yield the 20 masses and mixings of the quarks and leptons, and the 3 masses of the right-handed neutrinos.","created":"2000-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":37,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SO(10)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mixing angle: (neutrino/tau neutrino/mu)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: superfield"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: superfield"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Higgs"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"MSW effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":51,"citation_count":94,"authors":["Albright, Carl H.","Barr, Stephen M."]}

In this paper, we describe an algorithm for the tensor reduction of such diagrams. After connecting tensor integrals to scalar ones with arbitrary powers of propagators in higher dimensions, we derive recurrence relations from integration-by-parts and Lorentz-invariance identities, that allow us to write the scalar integrals as a combination of two master crossed boxes plus simpler-topology diagrams. We derive the system of differential equations that the two master integrals satisfy using two different methods, and we use one of these equations to express the second master integral as a function of the first one, already known in the literature. We then give the analytic expansion of the second master integral as a function of epsilon=(4-D)/2, where D is the space-time dimension, up to order O(epsilon^0).","created":"2000-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":30,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Bx"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.20.Ds"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.10.Kk"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.15.Bt"},{"source":"author","value":"Master integrals"},{"source":"author","value":"Tensor reduction"},{"source":"author","value":"Two-loop integrals"},{"source":"author","value":"Crossed box"},{"source":"author","value":"Crossed triangle"},{"source":"author","value":"Dimensional regularization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: massless"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"higher-order: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential equations: any-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"analytic properties"}],"num_refs":17,"citation_count":130,"authors":["Anastasiou, C.","Gehrmann, T.","Oleari, C.","Remiddi, E.","Tausk, J.B."]}

We numerically integrate the classical equations of motion using initial conditions sampled from various nonequilibrium probability distributions. Time-dependent expectation values of observables constructed from the canonical momentum are compared with thermal ones. It is found that a closed system, evolving from one initial condition, thermalizes to high precision in the thermodynamic limit, in a time-averaged sense. For ensembles consisting of many members with the same energy, we find that expectation values become stationary - and equal to the thermal values - in the limit of infinitely many members. Initial ensembles with a nonzero (noncanonical) spread in the energy density or other conserved quantities evolve to noncanonical stationary ensembles. In the case of a narrow spread, asymptotic values of primary observables are only mildly affected. In contrast, fluctuations and connected correlation functions will differ substantially from the canonical values. This raises doubts on the use of a straightforward expansion in terms of 1PI-vertex functions to study thermalization.","created":"2000-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"phi**n model: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: classical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n-point function: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"}],"num_refs":12,"citation_count":71,"authors":["Aarts, Gert","Bonini, Gian Franco","Wetterich, Christof"]}

For finite masses the coupling limits are studied as a function of the leptoquark mass. Some leptoquark models are found to describe the existing experimental data much better than the Standard Model.

{"title":"Supersymmetric extension of the standard model with naturally stable proton","abstract":"A new supersymmetric standard model based on N=1 supergravity is constructed, aiming at natural explanation for the proton stability without invoking an ad hoc discrete symmetry through R parity. The proton is protected from decay by an extra U(1) gauge symmetry. Particle contents are necessarily increased to be free from anomalies, making it possible to incorporate the superfields for right-handed neutrinos and an SU(2)-singlet Higgs boson. The vacuum expectation value of this Higgs boson, which induces spontaneous breakdown of the U(1) symmetry, yields large Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos, leading to small masses for the ordinary neutrinos. The linear coupling of SU(2)-doublet Higgs superfields, which is indispensable to the superpotential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, is replaced by a trilinear coupling of the Higgs superfields, so that there is no mass parameter in the superpotential. The energy dependencies of the model parameters are studied, showing that gauge symmetry breaking is induced by radiative corrections. Certain ranges of the parameter values compatible with phenomena at the electroweak energy scale can be derived from universal values of masses-squared and trilinear coupling constants for scalar fields at a very high energy scale.","created":"2000-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":32,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supergravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: singlet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: doublet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: superfield"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mu-problem"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":18,"citation_count":11,"authors":["Aoki, Mayumi","Oshimo, Noriyuki"]}

The baryon number is almost conserved at zero temperature by means of a localization mechanism recently analyzed by Arkani-Hamed and Schmaltz: leptons and quarks are located at two slightly displaced positions in the extra space, and this naturally suppresses the interactions which ``convert'' the latter in the former. We show that this is expected to be no longer true when finite temperature effects are taken into account. The whole scenario is first presented in its generality, without referring to the bulk geometry or to the specific mechanism which may generate the baryon asymmetry.

Investigating such systems out of equilibrium has recently been shown to display several interesting features. We extend here this type of investigations to finite temperature systems. Essentially the novel features observed at T=0 carry over to finite temperature. This is not unexpected, as the main mechanisms that determine the late-time behavior remain the same. We extend two empirical - presumably exact - relations for the late-time behavior to finite temperature and use them to define the boundaries between the region of different asymptotic regimes. This results in a phase diagram with the temperature and the initial value of the classical field as parameters, the phases being characterized by spontaneous symmetry breaking resp. symmetry restoration.

This enhancement pattern is very dependent on rather strict collinearity conditions between the photon and the quark momenta. It was estimated by neglecting the collisional width of quasi-particles. In this paper, we study the modifications of this collinear enhancement when we take into account the possibility for the quarks to have a finite mean free path. Assuming a mean free path of order $(g^2T\\ln(1/g))^{-1}$, we find that only low invariant mass photons are affected. The region where collision effects are important can be interpreted as the region where the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect plays a role in thermal photon production by bremsstrahlung. It is found that this effect modifies the spectrum of very energetic photons as well. Based on these results and on a previous work on infrared singularities, we end this paper by a reasonable physical picture for photon production by a quark gluon plasma, that should be useful to set directions for future technical developments.","created":"2000-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bremsstrahlung"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"infrared problem"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark antiquark: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":45,"citation_count":114,"authors":["Aurenche, P.","Gelis, F.","Zaraket, H."]}

For an explicit demonstration of such criteria, we present the relations between the current matrix elements in the two typical reference frames used for calculations of the exclusive amplitudes, i.e. the Drell-Yan-West and Breit frames and investigate both pseudoscalar and vector electromagnetic currents in detail. We find that the light-front helicities are unchanged and the good component of the current does not mix with the other components of the current under the transformation between these two frames. Thus, the pseudoscalar and vector form factors obtained by the diagonal convolution formalism in both frames must indeed be identical. However, such coincidence between the Drell-Yan-West and Breit frames does not hold in general. We give an explicit example in which the light-front helicities are changed and the plus component of the current is mixed with other components under the change of reference frame.

{"title":"On the Drell-Levy-Yan relation to O(alpha(s)**2)","abstract":"We study the validity of a relation by Drell, Levy and Yan (DLY) connecting the deep inelastic structure (DIS) functions and the single-particle fragmentation functions in e^+e^- annihilation which are defined in the spacelike (q^2<0) and timelike (q^2>0) regions respectively. Here q denotes the momentum of the virtual photon exchanged in the deep inelastic scattering process or the annihilation process. An extension of the DLY-relation, which originally was only derived in the scaling parton model, to all orders in QCD leads to a connection between the two evolution kernels determining the q^2-dependence of the DIS structure functions and the fragmentation functions respectively. In relation to this we derive the transformation relations between the space-and time-like splitting functions up to next-to-leading order (NLO) and the coefficient functions up to NNLO both for unpolarized and polarized scattering. It is shown that the evolution kernels describing the combined singlet evolution for the structure functions F_2(x,Q^2), F_L(x,Q^2) where Q^2=|q^2| or $F_2(x,Q^2), \\partial F_2(x,Q^2)/\\partial \\ln(Q^2)$ and the corresponding fragmentation functions satisfy the DLY relation up to next-to-leading order.

For evaluating the graphs, without resorting to a mass expansion, we apply a two-loop extension of the one-loop Passarino-Veltman reduction. This is an analytic-numerical method, which first converts all diagrams into a set of ten standard scalar functions, and then integrates them numerically over the remaining Feynman parameters, with rapid convergence and high accuracy. We discuss the treatment of infrared singularities within our methods. We do not resort to unitarity cuts of two-point functionsfor calculating decay rates; these are useful only to obtain an inclusive rate. For this reason, experimental cuts and the experimental infrared energy resolution can be implemented in our calculation, once the corresponding one-loop gluon Bremsstrahlung process is added to this calculation.","created":"2000-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"infrared problem"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"two-point function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: bremsstrahlung"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum: expansion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":19,"citation_count":7,"authors":["Ghinculov, Adrian","Yao, York-Peng"]}

{"title":"Thermal Production of Gravitinos","abstract":"The gravitino regeneration rate $\\Gamma_{\\overline{G}}$ is calculated perturbatively to the leading logarithmic and corresponding constant order in the strong coupling constant g. Two approaches of obtaining the coefficient of the leading logarithmic term, one starting from individual gravitino production processes and one applying the thermal version of the optical theorem, are shown to deliver analytically the same result. In the second approach the next-to-leading constant term is obtained along with that coefficient. Here the imaginary part of the gravitino self energy is calculated in the framework of hard thermal loop effective field theory, with a resummed gluon propagator for both soft and hard gluons. The constant is strongly depending on the gravitino energy E. As an application, the implications of a large baryogenesis temperature, $T_B$ = 0($10^{10}$ GeV), on the mass spectrum of superparticles have been re-analyzed with the new value for $\\Gamma_{\\overline{G}}$.

Asymmetries between s and s�� quark distributions in the nucleon are also predicted from the chiral properties of QCD.","created":"2000-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"protons"},{"source":"author","value":"structure functions"},{"source":"author","value":"quark models"},{"source":"author","value":"deep inelastic scattering"},{"source":"author","value":"flavour model"},{"source":"author","value":"elementary particle symmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Adelaide 2000/03/13"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: sea"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"antiquark: up"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"antiquark: down"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"asymmetry: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: strangeness"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":37,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Melnitchouk, W."]}
{"title":"Fragmentation functions for pions, kaons, and protons at next-to-leading order","abstract":"We present new sets of fragmentation functions for charged pions, charged kaons, and protons, both at the leading and next-to-leading orders. They are fitted to the scaled-momentum distributions of these hadrons measured in e+e- annihilation on the Z-boson resonance at CERN LEP1 and SLAC SLC. These data partly come as light-, charm-, bottom-quark-enriched and gluon-jet samples, which allows us to treat all partons independently, after imposing the SU(2) flavour symmetry relations. In order to gain sensitivity to the scaling violation in fragmentation, we also include data from SLAC PEP, with center-of-mass energy root(s)=29 GeV, in our fits. This allows us to also determine the strong-coupling constant, with a competitive error. LEP1 data on the longitudinal cross section as well as DESY DORIS and PETRA data at lower energies nicely agree with theoretical predictions based on our fragmentation functions.","created":"2000-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.65.+i"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.85.Ni"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.87.Fh"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: fragmentation function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charm"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: fragmentation function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction: coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section: x-dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CERN LEP Stor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"SLAC SPEAR Stor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"29.0: 91.2 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":48,"citation_count":566,"authors":["Kniehl, Bernd A.","Kramer, G.","Potter, B."]}
{"title":"Coherent exclusive exponentiation for precision Monte Carlo calculations","abstract":"We present the new Coherent Exclusive Exponentiation (CEEX), the older Exclusive Exponentiation (EEX) and the semi-analytical Inclusive Exponentiation (IEX) for the process $e^+e^-\\to f\\bar{f} +n\\gamma$, $f=\\mu,\\tau,d,u,s,c,b$ with validity for centre of mass energies from $\\tau$ lepton threshold to 1TeV, that is for LEP1, LEP2, SLC, future Linear Colliders, $b,c,\\tau$-factories etc. They are based on Yennie-Frautschi-Suura exponentiation. In CEEX effects due to photon emission from initial beams and outgoing fermions are calculated in QED up to second-order, including all interference effects. Electroweak corrections are included in first-order, at the amplitude level. Beams can be polarized longitudinally and transversely, and all spin correlations are incorporated in an exact manner. EEX is more primitive, lacks initial-final interferences, but it is valuable for testing the newer CEEX. IEX provides us set of a sophisticated semi-analytical formulas for the total cross section and selected inclusive distributions which are mainly used for cross-checks of the MC results. We analyse numerical results at the Z-peak 189 GeV and 500 GeV for simple kinematical cuts (comparisons with IEX) and for realistic experimental cuts. Physical precision and technical precision are determined for the total cross section and for the charge asymmetry.","created":"2000-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":110,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: emission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum electrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: transverse"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: correlation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"master equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section: angular distribution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":63,"citation_count":577,"authors":["Jadach, S.","Ward, B.F.L.","Was, Z."]}

It is defined as an integration of the truly nonperturbative part of the full gluon propagator over the deep infrared region (soft momentum region). A nontrivial minimization procedure makes it possible to determine the value of the soft cutoff in terms of the corresponding nonperturbative scale parameter, which is inevitably present in any nonperturbative model for the full gluon propagator. We have shown for specific models of the full gluon propagator explicitly that the use of the infrared enhanced and finite gluon propagators lead to the vacuum energy density which is finite, always negative and it has no imaginary part (stable vacuum), while the infrared vanishing propagators lead to unstable vacuum and therefore they are physically unacceptable.","created":"2000-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"covariant gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":82,"citation_count":21,"authors":["Gogohia, V.","Kluge, G."]}
{"title":"Gravitino production in hybrid inflationary models","abstract":"It has been recently shown that it is possible to excite gravitinos in an expanding background due to a time varying scalar field oscillating at the bottom of the inflationary potential. The two components of the gravitino, namely helicity 1/2 and helicity 3/2, are excited differently due to the presence of different time varying mass scales in the problem. In this paper we analyse the production of both the helicities in a multi-chiral scenario, in particular focusing on a general model of hybrid inflation. Fermion production in hybrid models is very much different from that of the chaotic models discussed so far in the literature. In this paper we give a full account of gravitino production analytically and numerically. It is noticed that the creation of gravitinos does not take place in the first few oscillations of the inflaton field, rather the production is a gradual and delayed process. It takes roughly 30-40 oscillations to build up the production and for the saturation to take place it can even take longer time, depending on the model parameters. We give an estimation of the reheat temperature and a brief discussion upon back-reaction on the fermionic production, which could change the gravitino abundance.","created":"2000-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation: hybrid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"helicity: 1/2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"helicity: 3/2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitino: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"back reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs mechanism"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supergravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":44,"citation_count":32,"authors":["Bastero-Gil, Mar","Mazumdar, Anupam"]}

{"title":"Bottom quark electroproduction in variable flavor number schemes","abstract":"Two variable flavor number schemes are used to describe bottom quark production in deep inelastic electron-proton scattering. In these schemes the coefficient functions are derived from mass factorization of the heavy quark coefficient functions presented in a fixed flavor number scheme. Also one has to construct a parton density set with five light flavors (u,d,s,c,b) out of a set which only contains four light flavors (u,d,s,c).

The standard Higgs model is, however, trivial and can only be an effective field theory valid below some high energy scale characteristic of the underlying non-trivial physics. Corrections to the custodial isospin violating parameter T arising from interactions at this higher energy scale dramatically enlarge the allowed range of Higgs mass. We perform a fit to precision electroweak data and determine the region in the (m_H, Delta T) plane that is consistent with experimental results. Overlaying the estimated size of corrections to T arising from the underlying dynamics, we find that a Higgs mass up to 500 GeV is allowed. We review two composite Higgs models which can realize the possibility of a phenomenologically acceptable heavy Higgs boson.

If flavour changing neutral currents at tree level are to be avoided, one has four alternative ways of introducing the fermion couplings in both cases. In one of these models the mixing angle of the CP even sector can be chosen in such a way that the fermion couplings to the lightest scalar Higgs boson vanishes. At the same time it is possible to suppress the fermion couplings to the charged and pseudo-scalar Higgs boson by appropriately choosing the mixing angle of the CP odd sector.

On the one hand, performing high precision measurements to the SM, for example, when running with high luminosity at the Z boson resonance, could be a quick and feasible enterprise in order to pin down the symmetry breaking mechanism of the electroweak sector through indirectly determining the masses of a light SM or MSSM Higgs boson or supersymmetric particles via virtual corrections.

{"title":"Disentangling running coupling and conformal effects in QCD","abstract":"The coefficients in perturbative expansions in gauge theories are factorially increasing, predominantly due to renormalons. This type of factorial increase is not expected in conformal theories. In QCD conformal relations between observables can be defined in the presence of a perturbative infrared fixed-point. Using the Banks-Zaks expansion we study the effect of the large-order behavior of the perturbative series on the conformal coefficients. We find that in general these coefficients become factorially increasing. However, when the factorial behavior genuinely originates in a renormalon integral, as implied by a postulated skeleton expansion, it does not affect the conformal coefficients. As a consequence, the conformal coefficients will indeed be free of renormalon divergence, in accordance with previous observations concerning the smallness of these coefficients for specific observables. We further show that the correspondence of the BLM method with the skeleton expansion implies a unique scale-setting procedure. The BLM coefficients can be interpreted as the conformal coefficients in the series relating the fixed-point value of the observable with that of the skeleton effective charge. Through the skeleton expansion the relevance of renormalon-free conformal coefficients extends to real-world QCD.","created":"2000-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":42,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum electrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization: renormalon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion: conformal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":66,"citation_count":97,"authors":["Brodsky, Stanley J.","Gardi, Einan","Grunberg, Georges","Rathsman, Johan"]}

(i) The BRS sum rules hold exactly among the analytic expressions of the form factors of the $\\eeww$ amplitude and those of the amplitudes where the external $W^\\pm$ bosons are replaced by the corresponding Goldstone bosons $\\chi^\\pm$, hence they hold within the expected accuracy of the numerical program. (ii) The one-loop sfermion contribution to the amplitudes decouple in the heavy mass limit. This property is used to test the overall normalization of the amplitudes. In order to observe the analytically exact decoupling, the amplitudes are expanded by the $\\bar{\\rm MS}$ couplings of the Standard Model. (iii) The high-energy analytic formulas of the helicity amplitudes, which are verified by using the equivalence theorem analytically, are used for the numerical test of the high energy behavior of the amplitudes. We then investigate the magnitude of the one-loop effects on each helicity amplitude which may be measured by experiments at future linear colliders. Under the constraint from available precision data, the one-loop corrections to a few helicity amplitudes (for example, the longitudinal-$W$-pair production) can be at most from -0.8% to $+0.6$% in magnitude in the observables.

This gives rise to a $1/r$ potential and couples with infinitesimal strength to the inertial mass of known particles. If this is interpreted as the origin of Newtonian gravity one finds a natural solution of the hierarchy problem.

The hierarchical structure is induced by the power behavior of the cutoff dependence of the evolution equations which yield large suppressions of couplings at the compactification scale. The values of coupling constants at this scale can be made stable almost independently of the initial input parameters by utilizing the infrared fixed point. We find that the Yukawa couplings converge to the fixed points very quickly because of the enhanced energy dependence of the suppression factor from extra dimensions as well as in the case of large gauge couplings at high-energy scale.","created":"2000-02-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum gravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: space-time"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group: fixed point"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":35,"citation_count":28,"authors":["Bando, Masako","Kobayashi, Tatsuo","Noguchi, Tatsuya","Yoshioka, Koichi"]}

Four representative models - \\chi,\\psi, \\eta, \\nu models - are studied in some detail. We find that the improved data of parity violation in cesium atom, which is 2.2-\\sigma away from the Standard Model (SM) prediction, could be explained by the exchange of the heavy mass eigenstate Z_2 in the intermediate state. The improvement over the SM can be found in \\chi, \\eta, \\nu models, where the total \\chi^2 of the fit to the 26 data points decreases by about five units, owing to the better fit to the atomic parity violation. Impacts of the kinetic mixing between the U(1)_Y and U(1)' gauge bosons on the \\chi^2-analysis are studied.

{"title":"Photon mixing in universes with large extra dimensions","abstract":"In presence of a magnetic field, photons can mix with any particle having a two-photon vertex. In theories with large compact extra-dimensions, there exists a hierachy of massive Kaluza-Klein gravitons that couple to any photon entering a magnetic field. We study this mixing and show that, in comparison with the four dimensional situation where the photon couples only to the massless graviton, the oscillation effect may be enhanced due to the existence of a large number of Kaluza-Klein modes.

{"title":"Spin polarizabilities of the nucleon at NLO in the chiral expansion","abstract":"We present a calculation of the fourth-order (NLO) contribution to spin-dependent Compton scattering in heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory, and we give results for the four spin polarisabilities. No low-energy constants, except for the anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleon, enter at this order. For forward scattering the fourth-order piece of the spin polarisability of the proton turns out to be almost twice the size of the leading piece, with the opposite sign. This leads to the conclusion that no prediction can currently be made for this quantity. For backward scattering the fourth-order contribution is much smaller than the third-order piece which is dominated by the anomalous scattering, and so cannot explain the discrepancy between the CPT result and the current best experimental determination.","created":"2000-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"12.39Fe"},{"source":"author","value":"13.60Fz"},{"source":"author","value":"11.30Rd"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon nucleon: Compton scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: heavy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: spin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: polarizability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"}],"num_refs":14,"citation_count":75,"authors":["Vijaya Kumar, K.B.","McGovern, Judith A.","Birse, Michael C."]}

By integrating out these heavy Higgs particles to one-loop, we compute the effective action for the electroweak gauge bosons and find out that, in the decoupling limit, all the heavy Higgs effects can be absorbed into redefinitions of the Standard Model electroweak parameters. This demonstrates explicitely that the decoupling theorem works for the heavy MSSM Higgs particles. This is also compared with the paradigmatic and different case of the Standard Model heavy Higgs particle. Finally, this work together with our two previous works, complete the demonstration that all the non-standard particles in the MSSM, namely, squarks, sleptons, charginos, neutralinos and the heavy Higgs particles, decouple to one-loop from the low energy electroweak gauge boson physics.","created":"2000-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":26,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: heavy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decoupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: n-point function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":48,"citation_count":72,"authors":["Dobado, Antonio","Herrero, Maria J.","Penaranda, Siannah"]}

For this purpose, we first introduce parameters which represent violation of these symmetries in mixing parameters and decay amplitudes in a convenient and well-defined way and, treating these parameters as small, derive formulas which relate them to the experimentally measured quantities. We then perform numerical analyses, with the aid of the Bell-Steinberger relation, to derive constraints to these symmetry-violating parameters, firstly paying particular attention to the results reported by KTeV Collaboration and NA48 Collaboration, and then with the results reported by CPLEAR Collaboration as well taken into account. A case study, in which either CPT symmetry or T symmetry is assumed, is also carried out. It is demonstrated that CP and T symmetries are violated definitively at the level of 10^{-4} in $2\\pi$ decays and presumably at the level of 10^{-3} in the $\\ko-\\kob$ mixing, and that the Bell-Steinberger relation helps us to establish CP and T violations being definitively present in the $\\ko-\\kob$ mixing and to test CPT symmetry to a level of 10^{-4} ~ 10^{-5}.","created":"2000-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":21,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K0 anti-K0: mixing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K0: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K0: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K0: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time reversal: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"violation: CPT"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":5,"authors":["Kouchi, Yutaka","Takeuchi, Yoshihiro","Tsai, S.Y."]}

{"title":"Precision measurements of IVB parameters and bounds on new physics","abstract":"The main purpose of this thesis is to discuss the impact of electroweak precision measurements on the present knowledge of particle physics, both in the framework of the Standard Model and of its most straightforward extensions. In Chapter 1 we give a general overview of the electroweak sector of the SM and of SUSY phenomenology. In Chapter 2 we deal with different definitions of the electroweak mixing angle, with particular attention to the relation between the phenomenological angle $\\theta$ and the MS parameter $\\hat\\theta$. In Chapter 3 we use results found in the previous chapter to discuss in detail how both the decoupling and the non-decoupling approach to the running of coupling constants in the MS scheme produce the same numerical value of $m_{GUT}$, despite of the different initial conditions. In Chapter 4 we derive simple analytical formulas for the contribution of a chargino almost degenerate with the lightest neutralino to electroweak observables, showing that in the case of wino domination the study of oblique corrections allows a concrete improvement of experimental bounds on chargino mass. Finally, in Chapter 5 we consider the possibility of extra fermion generations, proving that they are strongly disfavoured by the present experimental data if all particles are heavier that Z-boson, while for the specific case of the extra neutrino around 50 GeV in mass (still allowed by experimental data) the quality of the fit is not worse than the SM.","created":"2000-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":104,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: validity test"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"regularization: renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction: coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"chargino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: postulated particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":57,"citation_count":7,"authors":["Maltoni, Michele"]}
