Since QED of massless charged fermions is invariant under the dilatation transformation, this symmetry has to be spontaneously broken to obtain massive fermions. In the proposed model we combine a mass-scale normalisation with the renormalisation procedure, assuming the fermion momentum space being a four-dimensional one-shell hyperboloid embedded in a five-dimensional space. The hyperboloid constrains the allowed fermion field solutions. We construct the theory in the conventional way using equal time anti-commutator and the Lagrangian formalism. Starting from the Dyson���Schwinger equation for fermion propagator in the Landau gauge, we derive the fermion mass function and self-reciprocal solutions for the mass ratios, which are independent of any constant.","created":"2001-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"Curved energy���momentum space"},{"source":"author","value":"Fermion mass ratios"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum electrodynamics: massless"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dyson-Schwinger equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Landau gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":15,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Bodmann, B.E.J.","Maris, T.A.J."]}

{"title":"Dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for confinement and chiral symmetry breaking","abstract":"We introduce the dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL) theory as a low energy effective theory of QCD. We study color confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking of nonperturbative QCD by using the DGL theory, where color monopole and its condensation play an essential role on the nonperturbative dynamics in the infrared region. As a result of the dual Meissner effect, the linear static quark potential, which characterizes the quark confinement, is obtained in the long distance. We investigate then the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking by using the Schwinger-Dyson equation, where the gluon propagator includes the nonperturbative effect related to monopole condensation. We find a large enhancement of the chiral-symmetry breaking when the dual Meissner effect takes place. We study the recovery of the chiral symmetry and the deconfinement at finite temperature in the DGL theory. We discuss then the essential assumption of the DGL theory, which is the abelian dominance for the infrared physics, in the maximal abelian (MA) gauge in lattice QCD. The lattice QCD simulation demonstrates that the non-abelian gluons have a finite mass of order of 1 GeV in the MA gauge. We introduce further the instanton configuration as the source of the color monopole. In the MA gauge, a monopole circles around an instanton and with the increase of the instanton density, the monopole loop connects many instantons and a complicated monopole loop covers the whole 4 dimensional space. This study indicates that instantons may be playing an essential role even for color confinement.","created":"2001-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"Dual Ginzburg-Landau theory"},{"source":"author","value":"Color monopole"},{"source":"author","value":"Confinement"},{"source":"author","value":"Chiral symmetry breaking"},{"source":"author","value":"QCD phase transition"},{"source":"author","value":"Abelian dominance"},{"source":"author","value":"lattice QCD"},{"source":"author","value":"Instanton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"review"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Landau-Ginzburg model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"duality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: confinement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dynamical symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Meissner effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dyson-Schwinger equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnetic monopole: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge: abelian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"instanton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: quenching"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"screening"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flux tube"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"glueball"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Wilson loop"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string tension"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":2,"citation_count":9,"authors":["Toki, H.","Suganuma, H."]}

{"title":"Light front quark model and analysis of the spectrum of photons from inclusive B --> X(s) gamma decays","abstract":"The electroweak-decay width ��(B ��� X s ��) is investigated in a light-front (LF) constituent quark model. A new partonlike formula is derived that establishes a simple relation between ��(B ��� X s ��) and the b ��� s�� decay width. A treatment of the b quark as an on-mass-shell particle and the inclusion of effects that arise from the transverse motion of the b quark in the B meson are basic features of this approach. Adopting different b-quark LF distribution functions, both phenomenological ones and those that are derived from constituent quark models, and neglecting perturbative corrections, we compute the photon energy spectra and the moments of the shape function. It is shown that the LF approach can be matched completely with a heavy-quark expansion (HQE), provided that the constituent b-quark mass is redefined in a way similar to that used in HQE to define the pole mass of the b quark. In this way, the correction to first order in 1/m b can be eliminated from the total width in agreement with the general statement of HQE. We also show that the photon energy spectra calculated in the LF approach agree well with those obtained in the model of Altarelli et al., provided that the same distribution function is used as an input in both cases. Despite the simplicity of the model, our results are in fairly good agreement both with HQE predictions and with available experimental data.","created":"2001-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strangeness"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: light front"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"HQET model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":63,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Kulikov, P.Yu.","Narodetsky, I.M."]}

{"title":"Anticommutative electric and magnetic charges, and the monopole question","abstract":"The monopole question is treated anew in the light of a recent, strictly covariant,extended formulation of fermion quantum field theory naturally including alsoa pseudoscalar variety of conserved charges. The essential novelty lies in theresulting quantum property of anticommutivity between scalar and pseudoscalarcharge varieties, which should in particular apply to electric and magnetic charges.As an immediate outcome, there should no longer be any (Dirac-like) quantizationcondition relating these charges and binding the magnetic elementary charge tohave a very great strength. A generalized Lagrangian approach to the monopoleproblem is made truly viable, leading to two independent local gauge couplingswhich are separately generated by the electric and magnetic elementary chargesand are not allowed to interfere. This would prevent electric and magneticmonopoles from mutually interacting and would particularly account for the���absence��� of magnetic sources in ordinary electromagnetism. Within such aframework, an electric charge eigenstate with a nonzero eigenvalue is bound tohave a null magnetic charge expectation value, and the magnetic dipole momentof an electrically charged point fermion may actually be seen as resulting fromthe additional internal presence of a single magnetic charge subjected to a maximaluncertainty in sign. An easy estimate makes it allowable to assign to this chargea strength just equal to that of the partner electric charge. Such a conjecture leadsto a ���dual��� model of a charged point fermion where the ���electric��� and ���magnetic���roles can well be interchanged with no observable effects. In the associatedformalism, duality symmetry is already included without the need to appeal toany ���missing��� electromagnetic phenomenology to be discovered.","created":"2001-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":18,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field equations: monopole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: electric"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: magnetic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: magnetic moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: pseudoscalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: conservation law"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"duality"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":3,"authors":["Ziino, G."]}
{"title":"Geometrical aspects of skyrmions, reflection group, and the internal symmetry of hadrons","abstract":"The topological aspects of skyrmions are studied and it is shown that hadronscan be viewed as composite states of baby skyrmions when the internal symmetrySU(3) is generated from reflection. It is shown that in an anisotropic space aparticle can move with l = 1/2 with a specific l x value, and a bosonic constituentmoving with l = 1/2 will appear as a baby skyrmion and a fermionic constituentwill appear as if a spin carrier is attached to a baby skyrmion. The associatedmagnetic field causes a strong statistical attraction which helps to form the boundstate of such constituents. The doublet of such particles having opposite l x valuesform a conformal spinor when each member behaves as a Cartan semispinor.The conformal reflection then helps us to generate the internal SU(3) symmetry,which splits as SU(3) ��� SU(2) �� U(1), giving rise to the hadronic spectra. Thestrong interaction involves a composite cluster in such a bound system whenrearrangement of the constituents takes place preserving the direction vectors,and an elementary constituent can take part in a weak interaction, causing parityviolation. These features help us to consider elementary constituents as knownparticles like leptons.","created":"2001-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":40,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Skyrmion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interaction: statistical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"topology"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnetic field: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"group theory: SO(4,1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spinor: conformal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: composite"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"weak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: magnetic moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron spectroscopy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":42,"citation_count":3,"authors":["Bandyopadhyay, P."]}

{"title":"On the dynamics of phase transitions and the nonequilibrium formation of topological defects","abstract":"We study the formation of topological defects in nonequilibrium phase transitions of both classical and quantum field theory. We examine three model systems. 1). The phase transition of a quantum scalar field in a FRW universe is analyzed through a first-principles approach in which the dynamics of the two-point function is derived from the two-loop, two-particle-irreducible closed-time-path effective action. Identifying signatures of correlated domains in the infrared portion of the momentum-space power spectrum we find that the domain size scales as a power-law with the expansion rate of the universe. The observed power-law scaling is in good agreement with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism of defect formation and provides evidence of the freeze-out scenario in the context of nonequilibrium quantum field theory. 2). The formation and interaction of topological textures is analyzed in the phase transition of a classical O(3) scalar field theory in 2+1 dimensions. We provide quantiive arguments that by the end of the transition the length scales of the texture distribution result from a competition between the length scale determined at freeze-out and the ordering dynamics of a textured system. 3). We discuss a black hole phase transition in semiclassical gravity. We review the thermodynamics of a black hole system and determine that the phase transition is entropically driven. We introduce a quantum atomic model of the equilibrium black hole system and show that the phase transition is realized as the abrupt excitation of a high energy state. We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the black hole phase transition and explore similar examples from the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in condensed matter to the Hagedorn transition in string theory.","created":"2001-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":99,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thesis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"defect: topological"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"black hole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation: semiclassical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"texture: topological"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":101,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Stephens, Gregory James"]}

{"title":"A Study of nucleon spin structure from quantum chromodynamics","abstract":"I present an introduction to the field of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with emphasis on nucleon spin structure and perturbative methods. After a somewhat comprehensive overview of perturbative QCD, including the systematics of renormalization, I introduce deeply-inelastic scattering and deeply-virtual Compton scattering along with the nonperturbative distribution functions appearing in these processes. I show how these processes can be used to extract the distribution of longitudinal spin of nucleons, and briefly discuss the complications associated with transverse spin components. There are five appendices which accompany this work, discussing topics ranging from canonical field quantization to dimensional regularization to the structure of several important Lie groups. These appendices are meant to give the reader a certain basic understanding of some of the mathematical details underlying the main text, as well as provide a useful reference.

This book presents a critical examination of the latest experimental results and confronts them with the predictions of the Standard Model. Besides discussions of accelerator results from LEP, HERA and the TEVATRON, attention is paid to the unresolved problems of neutrino oscillations, CP violation, dark matter and cosmology. New theoretical ideas are also analyzed in order to explore possible extensions of the standard model. Realistic plans for future accelerators are presented and their physics potential is discussed, paving the way for the next generation of particle physics experiments.","created":"2002-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":514,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"book"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"conference: Cargese 1999/07/26"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"particle physics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Aubert, J.J.","Gastmans, R.","Gerard, J.M."]}

{"title":"On the gravitational field of the electric charge","abstract":"The idea has been spoken that any of Dirac and Pauli form factors of leptonic current includes both normal and anomalous components. From this point of view, the dependence of independent parts of charge and magnetic moment is established with the use of cross sections of elastic scattering of unpolarized and longitudinal polarized electrons and their neutrinos by spinless nuclei. Some considerations of a connection between the mass of a particle and its electromagnetic nature are listed which can explain also the appearance of gravitational field of a Coulomb interaction. All they state that a massive four-component neutrino similarly to the electron must have the normal as well as the anomalous electric charge.","created":"2003-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: electric"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron nucleon: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino nucleus: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: mass"}],"num_refs":9,"citation_count":10,"authors":["Sharafiddinov, Rasulkhozha S."]}

It is observed that the total contribution of ve processes did not depend on the chemical potential of the magnetized electron-positron plasma.","created":"2010-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"plasma: magnetic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supernova"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino electron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy-momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"S-matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"kinematics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino electron: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":19,"citation_count":8,"authors":["Kuznetsov, A.V.","Mikheev, N.V."]}

In particular, scattering processes are analyzed both from the M(atrix)-Model and from the supergravity perspective and the corresponding $S$-Matrix elements are compared. We find impressive agreement between these two theories as long as only classical supergravity is considered. If one includes also quantum effects on the supergravity side, the agreement does not persist.

Infinitely many terms of the same order of magnitude arise. The numerical series to be summed is contained in the part of the theory reduced on 3D, which was recently treated non-perturbative as 2+1D Yang-Mills theory at T=0 by Karabali, Kim and Nair. In the thesis in question the exact 3D results are combined with the thermal 4D diagrammatic. In particular the splitting of the space-part of the transverse self-energy in the static limit is treated. As expected, the 3D subsystem can separate as regularized 3D Yang-Mills theory from the 4D structure. In 1-loop order the regulators are received explicit. For 2-loop order it can be shown amongst other things, that the generic contribution with hard inner momenta vanishes. It is examined, how the magnetic mass could follow. Under pressure it is possible to separate the 3D part in 1- and 2-loop order and to receive regulators.","created":"2011-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":87,"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Reinbach, J."]}
{"title":"Non-perturbative renormalization of the B-meson axial current","abstract":"by conversion from the MS scheme. Further studies made in this thesis are the determination of discretization errors in the step scaling function at one loop order, and the calculation of an improvement coefficient for the static-light axial current at one loop order to perturbation theory. The axial current of a light and a heavy quark is studied in the static approximation, with the aim of defining a non-perturbative renormalization scheme. To keep lattice artifacts small, O(a) improvement in the static approximation is discussed in detail. It is explained how a finite size scheme can be used to avoid the necessity of accommodating a large energy range on a single lattice in the determination of the scale dependence of the renormalized static-light axial current. To that end, Schroedinger functional boundary conditions are imposed on the static quark field, and a renormalization condition is formulated. As a central object of the SF scheme, the 'step scaling function', connecting the renormalization constants at different scales, is introduced. A large part of this thesis is to the expansion of suitable correlation functions to one loop order of perturbation theory. Using these expansions, the finite renormalization constants connecting the static-light axial current in the lattice MS scheme and the light-light axial current normalized by current algebra relations is calculated at one loop order. From this result, the relation of the renormalized static-light axial current in the SF scheme to the MS-renormalized static-light axial current is derived. Using that relation, the static-light axial current's two loop anomalous dimension in the SF scheme, which is needed for the calculation of the renormalization group invariant current, is calculated","created":"2011-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":99,"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Kurth, M."]}

{"title":"Phenomenology of Higgs bosons in various extensions of the Standard Model","abstract":"In the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, the Higgs sector is introduced���in order to explain the mass of gauge bosons and fermions without conflict with���the gauge principle. In the Higgs sector, the Higgs field ��, which have a non-zero���vacuum expectation value, is introduced, and then the existence of Higgs boson is���predicted. After the discovery of the top quark, the Higgs sector is the last���remaining part yet to be confirmed in the SM. Experimental search for the Higgs���boson has been continued at the Fermilab Tevatron experiments and will be succeeded���by the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and future linear colliders (LC's). ���Discovery of the Higgs boson is important not only in confirming the mechanism of the electroweak gauge-symmetry breaking but also in providing us useful information on physics beyond the SM. As such a physics, some models are proposed. For each���model, allowed properties of the Higgs boson is obtained. When the Higgs boson is���discovered, its mass and various decay properties will be measured to test the SM���and to distinguish models of new physics at high energy scales. In this thesis we���obtain allowed properties of the Higgs boson theoretically in various extensions���of the SM, e.g. two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) with a softly-broken discrete���symmetry, Zee-Model which requires the existence of a SU (2) charged Higgs singlet���in order to generate the small neutrino mass, and Minimal super-symmetric Standard���Model (MSSM).<br /><br />������The most interesting property of the Higgs boson is its mass value. Although���the mass of the Higgs boson is a free parameter in the SM, we can obtain its mass���bounds by demanding the considered theory to be a valid effective theory all the���way up to some cut-off energy scale (��); if we require the vacuum stability and���the validity of perturbation theory below a given cut-off scale ��, we can determine���the lower and the upper bounds of the Higgs boson mass as a function of ��, ���respectively, using renormalization group equations (RGE's). In the SM, for the���Planck scale m<SUB>p1</SUB>���10<SUP>19</SUP> GeV as ��, the lower and the upper bounds become about���145 and 175 GeV at m<SUB>t</SUB>���175 GeV, respectively.<br /><br />������In the MSSM which is the most popular in the particle models beyond the SM,���the theoretical upper bound on the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass is given by���about 120 GeV for m<SUB>t</SUB>���175 GeV and m<SUB>stop</SUB>���1 TeV.<br /><br />������The lightest CP-even Higgs-boson mass for the 2HDM is investigated. This model���includes one more Higgs doublet compared to the SM Higgs sector. This is the most���simple extension of the SM. Through spontaneous symmetry breaking, five physical���Higgs bosons appear, i.e. two CP-even, one CP-odd and a pairs of charged Higgs bosons.���In the 2HDM, the mass upper bound is the same as that of the SM, whereas the lower���bound is reduced to zero. Specially, in the decoupling regime, where only one neutral���Higgs boson is light as compared to the other physical states of Higgs bosons, the���lower bound of the lightest Higgs boson mass is given by 100 GeV for �����10<SUP>19</SUP>���GeV and m<SUB>t</SUB>���175 GeV. This is considerably smaller as compared to the SM value.<br /><br />������Next, the Higgs boson mass bounds for the Zee-Model is investigated. From the���observations of atmospheric and solar neutrinos, there are increasing evidences���for neutrino oscillations. If this is a correct interpretation, the SM has to be���extended to incorporate the small masses of the neutrinos suggested by data. There���has been several ideas proposed in literature to generate small neutrino masses. The���Zee-model is one of such attempts. In this model, the three different flavor���neutrinos are massless at the tree level, and their small masses are induced���radiatively through one-loop diagrams. For such a mass-generation mechanism to work,���it is necessary to extend the Higgs sector of the SM to contain at least two weak-doublet fields and one weak-singlet charged scalar field. The Higgs sector���of the Zee-model is similar to that of the 2HDM except for the existence of an���additional weak-singlet charged Higgs field, so that the physical scalar-bosons���include two CP-even, one CP-odd and two pairs of charged Higgs bosons. We show that���the mass bounds for the lightest CP-even Higgs boson are almost the same as those���in the 2HDM.<br /><br />������For the Zee-Model, although the allowed mass range is the same as that of the���2HDM, other properties can be different from that in the usual Higgs doublet model.���We examine effects of the additional loop contribution of the singlet charged Higgs���boson to the partial decay width of h�������. If we assume �����10<SUP>19</SUP> GeV, the���deviation of the decay width from the SM prediction can be about 20% within the���allowed range of the Higgs self-coupling constants which is obtained by the RGE���analysis. This amount of deviation could be tested at the future LC or photon-photon���LC experiments. We also discuss phenomenology of the singlet charged Higgs boson���at present and future collider experiments, which is found to be completely���different from that of the ordinary 2HDM-like charged Higgs bosons.","created":"2014-08-28T00:00:00+00:00","keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: charged particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: CP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass generation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Zee model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"singlet: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"minimal supersymmetric standard model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: discrete"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum: stability"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Kasai, Takashi"]}

{"title":"Nonperturbative production of fermions and the baryon asymmetry","abstract":"One simple possibility for generating the present baryon asymmetry is leptogenesis. It only requires the presence of right handed neutrinos (which naturally arise in many extensions of the Standard Model) and depends crucially on the mechanism responsible for their production. In particular, when their mass exceeds the inflaton mass (10<sup>13</sup> GeV in chaotic inflation) only non perturbative production can occur. It is reported here that non perturbative production of fermions in an expanding Universe is a very efficient mechanism up to masses of order of (10<sup>17</sup> ��� 10<sup>18</sup>) GeV, and that it can be easily applied to solve the baryon asymmetry problem.","created":"2015-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"baryon: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"fermion: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"inflaton: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"neutrino: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"inflation: chaos"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"leptogenesis"}],"num_refs":3,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Peloso, Marco"]}
{"title":"Preheating of Bosons in Supersymmetric Hybrid Inflation","abstract":"We study preheating of bosons in a general class of supersymmetric hybrid inflation model. Supersymmetry leads to only one coupling constant in the potential and thus only one natural frequency of oscillation for the homogeneous fields. We emphasise the importance of mixing effects in these models which can significantly change the rate of production of particles. We show how preheating is efficient in producing the quanta associated with the homogeneous fields. We apply these results to a realistic working model of supersymmetric hybrid inflation with approximate Peccei-Quinn symmetry, where production of axion could be dangerous. Finally we demonstrate the importance of backreaction effects in this model which have the effect of shutting off axion production.","created":"2015-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":4,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"inflation: hybrid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"supersymmetry: hybrid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"axion: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"inflation: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"symmetry: Peccei-Quinn"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"oscillation: frequency"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"preheating"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"back reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","source":"classifier","value":"mixing"}],"num_refs":10,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Bastero-Gil, M.","King, S.F.","Sanderson, J."]}

Links and junctions are introduced, they are interpreted as gluonic collective degrees offreedom and have their origin in the non Abelian nature ofthe theory. They have implications for the Pauli principie of quarks belonging to different hadrons. In the strong coupling limit, quarks of different nucleons are distinguishable and do not generate quark exchange effects and short range repulsion. The model predicts that the nuclear force at short distances receives unavoidably contributions from vector meson exchange. Dynamical chiral symmetry is implemented explicitly. The coupling of the pion generates dinamically the barion pion cloud. An e��fective hadronic Hamiltonian is constructed on the basis of a mapping technique of composite particles onto elementary particles. The e��fective Hamiltonian treats the effects of conf��nement and chiral symmetry in an unif��ed manner, and allows to treat perturbatively quark and gluon exchange effects at short distances.","created":"2016-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":146,"num_refs":72,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Rizzatto, Cleide Matheus"]}

Le cadre general de ce travail est la theorie des champs a temperature finie et plus precisement la theorie effective des boucles dures. Plusieurs aspects de ces observables sont une application directe de la theorie effective, d'autres necessitent le developpement de nouveaux outils : _ la methode des contre-termes afin d'eviter un eventuel double comptage ; _ une version theorie des champs a temperature finie du theoreme de kinoshita-lee-naunberg pour montrer la compensation des divergences infrarouges. La premiere partie de mon travail concerne la production de photons statiques virtuels. Je montre que le calcul a une boucle dans la theorie effective n'est pas suffisant et je complete l'estimation du taux de production par le calcul a deux boucles. Le deuxieme volet de mon travail est l'etude de la production de photons reels et quasi reels. Les divergences colineaires rendent les diagrammes a deux boucles aussi importants que le diagramme a une boucle. Pres du cone de lumiere les ordres superieurs sont aussi importants que le resultat a deux boucles. La premiere methode utilise pour inclure ces effets non perturbatifs est l'approximation eikonale ou je montre que des compensations entre les differents diagrammes font que la somme de toutes ces corrections est nulle. Il faut donc aller au-dela de l'approximation eikonale et pour cela je fais le calcul a deux boucles avec des particules instables. Je mets en evidence le phenomene de suppression du spectre du photon due aux collisions multiples dans le plasma, un effet nomme l'effet lpm d'apres landau-pomeranchuck-migdal.

We further, investigate the flavour violating leptonic decays of charged and neutral pseudoscalar mesons. Such decays set bounds on certain products of couplings arising from LLe^c and LQd^c operators. Some of the bounds derived are competitive with existing ones, some are new and others are improved.

{"title":"Supersymmetry versus precision experiments revisited","abstract":"We study constraints on the supersymmetric standard model from the updated electroweak precision measurements ��� the Z-pole experiments and the W-boson mass measurements. The supersymmetric-particle contributions to the universal gauge-boson-propagator corrections are parametrized by the three oblique parameters S Z , T Z and m W . The oblique corrections, the Zqq and Zll vertex corrections, and the vertex and box corrections to the �� -decay width are separately studied in detail. We first study individual contribution from the four sectors of the model, the squarks, the sleptons, the supersymmetric fermions (charginos and neutralinos), and the supersymmetric Higgs bosons, to the universal oblique parameters, where the sum of individual contributions gives the total correction. We find that the light squarks or sleptons, whose masses just above the present direct search limits, always make the fit worse than that of the Standard Model (SM), whereas the light charginos and neutralinos generally make the fit slightly better. The contribution from the supersymmetric Higgs sector is found small. We then study the vertex/box corrections carefully when both the supersymmetric fermions (-inos) and the supersymmetric scalars (squarks and sleptons) are light, and find that no significant improvement over the SM fit is achieved. The best overall fit to the precision measurements are found when charginos of mass ���100 GeV with a dominant wino-component are present and the doublet squarks and sleptons are all much heavier. The improvement over the SM is marginal, however, where the total �� 2 of the fit to the 22 data points decreases by about one unit, due mainly to a slightly better fit to the Z-boson total width.","created":"1999-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":61,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.30.Pb"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.15.Lk"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.60.Jv"},{"source":"author","value":"Supersymmetry"},{"source":"author","value":"Electroweak precision measurement"},{"source":"author","value":"Radiative correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: validity test"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vertex function: (Z0 lepton antilepton)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vertex function: (Z0 quark antiquark)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":101,"citation_count":83,"authors":["Cho, Gi-Chol","Hagiwara, Kaoru"]}

On the other hand, in case there is explicit CP violation in the stop and chargino/neutralino sectors, the relative phase between the Higgses does become space dependent, but only mildly even in the maximal case. We also demonstrate that spontaneous CP violation within the bubble wall could occur, e.g., if the Higgs sector of the MSSM were supplemented by a singlet. Finally we point out some implications for baryogenesis computations.","created":"1999-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena: bubble"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"doublet: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":49,"citation_count":30,"authors":["Huber, S.J.","John, P.","Laine, M.","Schmidt, M.G."]}
{"title":"Impact of radiative corrections on sterile neutrino scenarios","abstract":"In sterile neutrino scenarios, radiative corrections induce mass splittings proportional to the top Yukawa coupling, in contrast to the three active neutrino case where the induced splittings are proportional to the tau Yukawa coupling. In view of this, we have analyzed the stability of the four-neutrino schemes favored by oscillation experiments, consisting in two pairs of nearly degenerate neutrinos separated by the LSND gap. Requiring compatibility with the measurements of the abundances of primordial elements produced in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, we find that when the heaviest pair corresponds to the solar neutrinos (mainly an admixture of nu_e - nu_s) the natural mass splitting is 3-5 orders of magnitude larger than the observed one, discrediting the scenario from a theoretical point of view. On the contrary, the scheme where the heaviest pair corresponds to the atmospheric neutrinos (mainly an admixture of nu_mu - nu_tau) is safe from radiative corrections due to the small sterile component of these mass eigenstates.","created":"1999-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":46,"citation_count":12,"authors":["Ibarra, A.","Navarro, I."]}

The anomalous dimension is very different from that obtained from the fixed coupling equation, and leads to a powerlike behaviour for the splitting function as x ->0 which is far weaker, i.e. about x^(-0.2).

A discovery through direct observation of resonances is possible only for compactification scales below 6 TeV.

We find that LHC can probe compactification scales as high as 20 TeV for excitations of gluons and 8���15 TeV for excitations of electroweak gauge bosons. Finally, in the case where no gauge boson feels the extra-dimension, we find that effective contact interactions due to massive string mode oscillations dominate those due to the exchange of Kaluza���Klein excitations of gravitons and could be used to obtain bounds on the string scale.","created":"1999-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"orbifold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: excited state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: excited state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"compactification"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"oscillation: string"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"graviton: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: storage ring"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: CERN LHC Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":91,"citation_count":164,"authors":["Accomando, E.","Antoniadis, Ignatios","Benakli, K."]}

We consider the radiative mechanisms which transfer a possibly large CP-violating phase in the leptonic sector to the theta parameter. It is found that large theta cannot be induced in the models with one Higgs doublet as at least three loops are required in this case. In the models with two or more Higgs doublets the dominant source of theta is the phases in the scalar potential, induced by CP violation in leptonic sector. Thus, in the MSSM framework the imaginary part of the trilinear soft-breaking parameter A_l generates the corrections to the theta angle already at one loop. These corrections are large, excluding the possibility of large phases, unless the universality in the slepton sector is strongly violated.","created":"1999-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":5,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: Theta parameter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"doublet: 1"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction: CP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":43,"citation_count":6,"authors":["Dedes, A.","Pospelov, M."]}

We discuss how to systematically go beyond leading logarithmic order in the analysis of physical quantities. Specifically, we extend to next-to-leading-log order (NLLO) the simple leading-log effective theory due to Bodeker that describes non-perturbative color physics in hot non-Abelian plasmas. A suitable scaling analysis is used to show that no new operators enter the effective theory at next-to-leading-log order. However, a NLLO calculation of the color conductivity is required, and we report the resulting value.

We show that if only contributions of order $1/N_c^2$ are included, the problem is greatly simplified. Only a very limited number of states are possible, and we present an orthogonalization procedure for these states. The result is simple and intuitive and could give an estimate of the possibility to produce color separated gluonic subsystems, if no dynamical effects are important. We also study with a simple MC the possibility that configurations which correspond to \"short strings\" are dynamically favored. The advantage of our approach over more elaborate models is its simplicity, which makes it easier to estimate color reconnection effects in reactions which are more complicated than the relatively simple $e^+e^-$ annihilation.","created":"1999-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":21,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: associated production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: multiplicity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Hamiltonian: color"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"S-matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: singlet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rapidity spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"event shape analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charged particle: multiplicity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: Monte Carlo"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"91 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":29,"citation_count":18,"authors":["Wang, Qun","Gustafson, Gosta","Xie, Qu-bing"]}

This epoch is either the `intermediate epoch' when Hubble parameter falls below the gravitino mass, or the reheat epoch if that is earlier.

We further find that unlike the generic lepto-quark models, the extra contributions to the dipole moments of the leptons can only be enhanced by m_b/m_l and not by m_t/m_l relative to the expectations in the Standard Model. An interesting feature about this enhancement of these dipole moments is that it does not involve unknown mixing angles.

We show in this paper how the use of tools already employed in inclusive calculations can be suitably extended to the computation of loop integrals appearing in the virtual corrections to exclusive observables, namely two-loop four-point functions with massless propagators and up to one off-shell leg. We find that multi-leg integrals, in addition to integration-by-parts identities, obey also identities resulting from Lorentz-invariance. The combined set of these identities can be used to reduce the large number of integrals appearing in an actual calculation to a small number of master integrals. We then write down explicitly the differential equations in the external invariants fulfilled by these master integrals, and point out that the equations can be used as an efficient method of evaluating the master integrals themselves. We outline strategies for the solution of the differential equations, and demonstrate the application of the method on several examples.","created":"1999-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":25,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Bx"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.20.Ds"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"02.30.Hq"},{"source":"author","value":"Two-loop integrals"},{"source":"author","value":"Box diagrams"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"higher-order: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n-point function: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential equations: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"master equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"invariance: Lorentz"}],"num_refs":16,"citation_count":762,"authors":["Gehrmann, T.","Remiddi, E."]}

It is shown that the crucial physical principles of gauge-invariance, unitarity, and gauge-fixing-parameter independence single out at two loops exactly the same algorithm which has been used to define the pinch technique at one loop, without any additional assumptions. The two-loop construction of the pinch technique gluon self-energy, and quark-gluon vertex are carried out in detail for the case of mass-less Yang-Mills theories, such as perturbative QCD. We present two different but complementary derivations. First we carry out the construction by directly rearranging two-loop diagrams. The analysis reveals that, quite interestingly, the well-known one-loop correspondence between the pinch technique and the background field method in the Feynman gauge persists also at two-loops. The renormalization is discussed in detail, and is shown to respect the aforementioned correspondence. Second, we present an absorptive derivation, exploiting the unitarity of the $S$-matrix and the underlying BRS symmetry; at this stage we deal only with tree-level and one-loop physical amplitudes. The gauge-invariant sub-amplitudes defined by means of this absorptive construction correspond precisely to the imaginary parts of the $n$-point functions defined in the full two-loop derivation, thus furnishing a highly non-trivial self-consistency check for the entire method.

The rate for the process $gg \\rightleftharpoons q{\\bar q}$ is found to be much less as compared to the most commonly used factorized result obtained on the basis of classical approximation. This discrepancy, which is found both at zero as well as at finite baryon densities, however, is not due to the lack of quantum statistics in the classical approximation, rather due to the use of Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distribution functions for partons instead of Boltzmann distribution which is appropriate under such approximation. Interestingly, the rates of parton production are found to be insensitive to the baryo-chemical potential particularly when the plasma is unsaturated although the process of chemical equilibration strongly depends on it. The thermal photon yields, have been calculated specifically from unsaturated plasma at finite baryon density. The exact results obtained numerically are found to be in close agreement with the analytic expression derived using factorized distribution functions appropriate for unsaturated plasma. Further, it is shown that in the case of unsaturated plasma, the thermal photon production is enhanced with increasing baryon density both at fixed temperature and fixed energy density of the quark gluon plasma.","created":"1999-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon gluon: fusion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"production: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: emission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boson: statistics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: statistics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: chemical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":29,"citation_count":15,"authors":["Dutta, D.","Mohanty, A.K.","Kumar, K.","Choudhury, R.K."]}

This study deals with the region below the K - Kbar threshold. In particular, we study the 'up-steep' solution containing a narrow S-wave resonance under the rho(770). This solution exhibits a considerable inelasticity (eta) which does not have any physical interpretation. Assuming that this inelasticity behaviour represents an unlikely fluctuation we impose eta = 1 for all data points. This leads to non-physical results in one third of the pi+pi- effective mass bins and in the remaining mass bins some parameters behave in a queer way. The situation is even worse for the 'down-steep' solution. We conclude that the 17.2 GeV data cannot be described by a relatively narrow f0(750). The 'down-flat' and 'up-steep' solutions which easily pass the eta = 1 constraint exhibit a slow increase of phase shifts in the rho(770) mass range.","created":"1999-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi- p: inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: polarized target"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: transverse"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi+: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"threshold: (K anti-K)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partial wave analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum: (pi+ pi-)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi pi: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rho(770)0"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: f0(750)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":22,"citation_count":18,"authors":["Kaminski, R.","Lesniak, L.","Rybicki, K."]}

{"title":"An Analysis of a heavy gluino LSP at CDF: The Heavy gluino window","abstract":"In this paper we consider a heavy gluino to be the lightest supersymmetric particle [LSP]. We investigate the limits on the mass of a heavy gluino LSP, using the searches for excess events in the jets plus missing momentum channel in Run I. The neutral and charged R-hadrons, containing a heavy gluino LSP, have distinct signatures at the Fermilab Tevatron. The range of excluded gluino masses depends on whether the R-hadron is charged or neutral and the amount of energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter. The latter depends on the energy loss per collision in the calorimeter and the number of collisions/ where both quantities require a model for R-hadron- Nucleon scattering. We show how the excluded range of gluino mass depends on these parameters. We find that gluinos with mass in the range between $\\sim 35$ GeV and $\\sim 115$ GeV are excluded by CDF Run I data. Combined with previous results of Baer et al., which use LEP data to exclude the range 3 - 22$\\sim$25 GeV, our result demonstrates that an allowed window for a heavy gluino with mass between 25 and 35 GeV is quite robust.

Since the logarithm of the volume rather than the volume itself is the natural variable, parameters of O(10) in the potential can generate an exponentially large size for the extra dimensions. This provides a true solution to the hierarchy problem, on the same footing as technicolor or dynamical supersymmetry breaking. The area moduli have a Compton wavelength of about a millimeter and mediate Yukawa interactions with gravitational strength.

{"title":"Invisible axions and large radius compactifications","abstract":"We study some of the novel effects that arise when the QCD axion is placed in the ``bulk'' of large extra spacetime dimensions. First, we find that the mass of the axion can become independent of the energy scale associated with the breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry. This implies that the mass of the axion can be adjusted independently of its couplings to ordinary matter, thereby providing a new method of rendering the axion invisible. Second, we discuss the new phenomenon of laboratory axion oscillations (analogous to neutrino oscillations), and show that these oscillations cause laboratory axions to ``decohere'' extremely rapidly as a result of Kaluza-Klein mixing. This decoherence may also be a contributing factor to axion invisibility. Third, we discuss the role of Kaluza-Klein axions in axion-mediated processes and decays, and propose several experimental tests of the higher-dimensional nature of the axion. Finally, we show that under certain circumstances, the presence of an infinite tower of Kaluza-Klein axion modes can significantly accelerate the dissipation of the energy associated with cosmological relic axion oscillations, thereby enabling the Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scale to exceed the usual four-dimensional relic oscillation bounds. Together, these ideas therefore provide new ways of obtaining an ``invisible'' axion within the context of higher-dimensional theories with large-radius compactifications.","created":"1999-12-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":44,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: axion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction: CP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"axion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"axion: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"axion: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decoherence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: dissipation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dilaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"compactification"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":35,"citation_count":102,"authors":["Dienes, Keith R.","Dudas, Emilian","Gherghetta, Tony"]}

We use the comoving curvature perturbation, which remains constant on super-Hubble scales, in order to calculate the spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations generated. Modifications to the Friedmann constraint equation lead to a faster Hubble expansion at high energies and a more strongly damped evolution of the scalar field. This assists slow-roll, enhances the amount of inflation obtained in any given model, and drives the perturbations towards an exactly scale-invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum. In chaotic inflation driven by a massive scalar field we show that inflation can occur at field values far below the four-dimensional Planck scale, though above the five-dimensional fundamental scale.","created":"1999-12-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":5,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation: induced"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"chaos"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"massive"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"}],"num_refs":41,"citation_count":533,"authors":["Maartens, Roy","Wands, David","Bassett, Bruce A.","Heard, Imogen"]}

Using a model with scalar and fermionic degrees of freedom which should describe the two-flavor chiral phase-transition, we discuss the mechanism behind fermion decoupling and universality at second order transitions. It turns out that an effective mass-like term in the fermion propagator which is due to thermal fluctuations and does not break chiral symmetry is necessary for fermion decoupling to work. This situation is in contrast to the high-temperature limit, where the dominance of scalar over fermionic degrees of freedom is due to the different behavior of the distribution functions. The mass-like contribution is the leading thermal effect in the fermionic sector and is missed if a derivative expansion of the fermionic propagator is performed. We also discuss results on the phase-transition of the model considered where we find good agreement with results from other methods.","created":"1999-12-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":29,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: decoupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"universality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dispersion relation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson quark: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":41,"citation_count":6,"authors":["Bergerhoff, Bastian","Manus, Johannes","Reingruber, Jurgen"]}

{"title":"Inflationary Affleck-Dine scalar dynamics and isocurvature perturbations","abstract":"We consider the evolution of the Affleck-Dine scalar during D-term and F-term inflation and solve the combined slow-roll equations of motion. We show that for a typical case, where both the Affleck-Dine scalar and inflaton initially have large values, in D-term inflation the Affleck-Dine scalar is driven to a fixed value, with only a very slight dependence on the number of e-foldings. As a result, there is a definite prediction for the ratio of the baryonic isocurvature perturbation to the adiabatic perturbation. In minimal (d=4) Affleck-Dine baryogenesis the relative isocurvature contribution to the CMB angular power spectrum amplitude is predicted to be in the range $0.01-0.1$, which can account for present large-scale structure observations and should be observable by PLANCK. In a very general case, scale-invariance of the adiabatic perturbations from the Affleck-Dine scalar imposes a lower bound of about 0.01 for d=4. For d=6 the isocurvature perturbation may just be observable, although this is less certain. We also consider F-term inflation and show that the magnitude of the baryonic isocurvature perturbation is fixed by the value of $H$ during inflation. For typical values of $H$ the isocurvature perturbation could be close to present observational limits.","created":"1999-12-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation: D-term"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation: F-term"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation: adiabatic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling: invariance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmic background radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmic radiation: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":45,"citation_count":51,"authors":["Enqvist, Kari","McDonald, John"]}

It has recently been shown that such an IMH can be generated radiatively, making use of infra-red fixed point properties of renormalization group equations given Yukawa coupling unification and suitable $GUT$ scale boundary conditions on soft SUSY breaking masses.

The recently-proposed approach to the gauge hierarchy problem by using this background geometry, with the SM confined on a boundary, is extended to a situation where (some of) the SM particles reside in the five dimensional bulk. In particular, we find a localization of zero modes of bulk fermions near the boundary with a negative tension. Unlike the compactification with the flat metric, these fermion zero modes couple to Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the SM gauge bosons. Interestingly, only low-lying modes of such KK gauge bosons have non-negligible couplings. Current electroweak precision data give a constraint that the first KK mode be heavier than 9 TeV. We also argue that at least the Higgs field should be confined on the brane to utilize the Randall-Sundrum background as a solution to the gauge hierarchy.","created":"1999-12-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Randall-Sundrum model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: anti-de Sitter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"compactification"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hierarchy: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: zero mode"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: excited state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"geometry: background"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":48,"citation_count":370,"authors":["Chang, Sanghyeon","Hisano, Junji","Nakano, Hiroaki","Okada, Nobuchika","Yamaguchi, Masahiro"]}

In particular, we investigate a non-forward unequal mass virtual Compton scattering amplitude by performing the general operator product expansion (OPE) and the formal renormalization group (RG) analysis. We discuss the general tensorial decomposition of the amplitude to obtain the invariant amplitudes in the non-forward kinematic region. We study the OPE to identify the relevant operators and their reduced matrix elements, as well as the corresponding Wilson coefficients. We find that the OPE now should be done in double moments with new moment variables. There are in the expansion new sets of leading twist operators which have overall derivatives. They mix under renormalization in a well-defined way. We compute the evolution kernels from which the anomalous dimensions for these operators can be extracted. We also obtain explicitly the lowest order Wilson coefficients. In the high energy limit we find the explicit form of the dominantly contributing anomalous dimensions. We are then able to solve the resulting renormalization group equations (RGE) and give a prediction of the high energy behavior of the invariant amplitudes.

Bounds on the parameter space of the model can be placed by comparison of specific processes with the SM background as well as by the latest Cavendish experiments.

{"title":"Unitarity and the QCD improved dipole picture","abstract":"As a consequence of QCD factorization theorems, a wide variety of inclusive and exclusive cross sections may be formulated in terms of a universal colour dipole cross section at small $x$. It is well known that for small transverse size dipoles this cross section is related to the leading-log gluon density. Using the measured pion-proton cross section as a guide, we suggest a reasonable extrapolation of the dipole cross section to the large transverse size region. We point out that the observed magnitude and small $x$ rise of the gluon density from conventional fits implies that the DGLAP approximation has a restricted region of applicability. We found that `higher twist' or unitarity corrections are required in, or close to, the HERA kinematic region, even for small `perturbative' dipoles for scattering at central impact parameters. This means that the usual perturbative leading twist description, for moderate virtualities, $1 < Q^2 < 10$ GeV$^2$, has rather large `higher twist' corrections at small $x$. In addition, for these virtualities, we also find sizeable contributions from large non-perturbative dipoles ($b \\gsim 0.4$ fm) to $F_2$, and also to $F_L$. This also leads to deviations from the standard leading twist DGLAP results, at small $x$ and moderate $Q^2$. Our model also describes the low $Q^2$ data very well without any further tuning. We generalize the Gribov unitarity limit for the structure functions of a hadron target to account for the blackening of the interaction at central impact parameters and to include scattering at peripheral impact parameters which dominate at extremely large energies.","created":"2000-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":29,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"structure function: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: dipole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unitarity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: impact parameter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi p: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"small-x"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":38,"citation_count":100,"authors":["McDermott, M.","Frankfurt, L.","Guzey, V.","Strikman, M."]}

The kinematic effect of soft particle emission is usually a higher-order effect in the non-relativistic expansion, but becomes important near the kinematic endpoint of quarkonium energy (momentum) distributions. In an intermediate region a systematic resummation of the non-relativistic expansion leads to the introduction of so-called `shape functions'. In this paper we provide an implementation of the kinematic effect of soft gluon emission which is consistent with the non-relativistic shape function formalism in the region where it is applicable and which models the extreme endpoint region. We then apply the model to photoproduction of $J/\\psi$ and $J/\\psi$ production in $B$ meson decay. A satisfactory description of $B$ decay data is obtained.

{"title":"The Spin structure of the proton","abstract":"It is shown that the proton \"spin crisis'' or \"spin puzzle\" can be understood by the relativistic effect of quark transversal motions due to the Melosh-Wigner rotation. The quark helicity $\\Delta q$ measured in polarized deep inelastic scattering is actually the quark spin in the infinite momentum frame or in the light-cone formalism, and it is different from the quark spin in the nucleon rest frame or in the quark model. The flavor asymmetry of the Melosh-Wigner effect for the valence $u$ and $d$ quarks and the intrinsic sea $q \\bar{q}$ pairs are also the important ingredients in a SU(6) quark-spectator-diquark model framework to understand the \"spin puzzle\". Such a picture of the spin structure can be tested by use of several simple relations to measure the quark spin distributions in the quark model.","created":"2000-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Wako 1999/11/04"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: spin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"structure function: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: helicity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: diquark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light cone"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(6)"}],"num_refs":17,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Ma, Bo-Qiang"]}

Those mixings are not observable in the SM where only the CKM quark mixing matrix can be measured, but they have testable effects on the branching ratios of nucleon decays in theories beyond the SM. One finds that decay channels with positrons in the final state are suppressed while channels with antimuons and antineutrinos are enhanced compared to models with small mixings. The total nucleon lifetimes obtained should be observable by future experiments. The SO(10) model also predicts the masses and mixings of the light neutrinos.

{"title":"An Open universe from valley bounce","abstract":"It appears difficult to construct a simple model for an open universe based on the one bubble inflationary scenario. The reason is that one needs a large mass to avoid the tunneling via the Hawking Moss solution and a small mass for successful slow-rolling. However, Rubakov and Sibiryakov suggest that the Hawking Moss solution is not a solution for the false vacuum decay process because it does not satisfy the boundary condition. Hence, we have reconsidered the arguments for the defect of the simple polynomial model. We point out the possibility that one of the valley bounce belonging to a valley line in the functional space represents the decay process instead of the Hawking Moss solution. Under this presumption, we show an open inflation model can be constructed within the polynomial form of the potential so that the fluctuations can be reconciled with the observations.","created":"1999-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":35,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"98.80.Cq"},{"source":"author","value":"One-bubble open universe"},{"source":"author","value":"Valley method"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: de Sitter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spectrum: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tunneling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":29,"citation_count":3,"authors":["Koyama, Kazuya","Maeda, Kayoko","Soda, Jiro"]}

{"title":"Stochastic treatment of disoriented chiral condensates within a Langevin description","abstract":"Applying a microscopically motivated semi-classical Langevin description of the linear sigma model we investigate for various different scenarios the stochastic evolution of a disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) in a rapidly expanding system. Some particular emphasize is put on the numerical realisation of colored noise in order to treat the underlying dissipative and nonmarkovian stochastic equations of motion. A comparison with an approximate markovian (i.e. instantaneous) treatment of dissipation and noise will be made in order to identify the possible influence of memory effects in the evolution of the chiral order parameter. Assuming a standard Rayleigh cooling term to simulate a D-dimensional scaling expansion we present the probability distribution in the low momentum pion number stemming from the relaxing zero mode component of the chiral field. The best DCC signal is expected for initial conditions centered around $<\\sigma > \\approx 0 $ as would be the case of effective light `pions' close to the phase transition. By choosing appropriate idealized global parameters for the expansion our findings show that an experimentally feasible DCC, if it does exist in nature, has to be a rare event with some finite probability following a nontrivial and nonpoissonian distribution on an event by event basis. DCCs might then be identified experimentally by inspecting higher order factorial cumulants $\\theta_m$ ($m\\ge 3$) in the sampled distribution.","created":"1999-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":67,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"phi**n model: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Langevin equation: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: semiclassical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boundary condition"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"condensation: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field equations: stochastic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":67,"citation_count":40,"authors":["Xu, Zhe","Greiner, Carsten"]}

When measured near the end of the transition the texture separation and the texture width scale respectively as \\tau^(0.39 \\pm 0.02) and \\tau^(0.46 \\pm 0.04), significantly larger than \\tau^(0.25) predicted from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We show that Kibble-Zurek scaling is recovered at very early times but that by the end of the transition the power-laws result instead from a competition between the length scale determined at freeze-out and the ordering dynamics of a textured system. In the context of phase ordering these results suggest that the multiple length scales characteristic of the late-time ordering of a textured system derive from the critical dynamics of a single nonequilibrium correlation length. In the context of defect formation these results imply that significant evolution of the defect network can occur before the end of the phase transition. Therefore a quantitative understanding of the defect network at the end of the phase transition generally requires an understanding of both critical dynamics and the interactions among topological defects.","created":"1999-11-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"texture: topological"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: O(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation: length"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":46,"citation_count":12,"authors":["Stephens, G.J."]}

Since the supersymmetric vacuum condition required by the D-term potential contradicts the one required by the superpotential, supersymmetry is broken.

Global fits to electroweak observables provide lower bounds on 1/R, which are generically in the 2-5 TeV range.

We also consider the case of softly-broken supersymmetric theories and we find new non-decoupling effects that put new constraints on 1/R. If quarks of different families live in different points of the extra dimension, we find that the Kaluza-Klein modes of the SM gluons generate (at tree level) dangerous flavor and CP-violating interactions.

If supersymmetry is broken on another 3-brane, supersymmetry breaking is communicated to gauge and Higgs fields by direct higher-dimension interactions, and to quark and lepton fields via standard-model loops. We show that this gives rise to a realistic and predictive model for supersymmetry breaking. The size of the extra dimensions is required to be of order 10-100 times larger than fundamental scale (e.g. the string scale). The spectrum is similar to (but distinguishable from) the predictions of \"no-scale\" models. Flavor-changing neutral currents are naturally suppressed. The \\mu term can be generated by the Giudice-Masiero mechanism. The supersymmetric CP problem is naturally solved if CP violation occurs only on the observable sector 3-brane.

The Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos are generated around the supersymmetry breaking scale through the vacuum expectation value of the singlet Higgs field. This model may induce spontaneous R-parity violation via the vacuum expectation value of the right-handed sneutrino. In the case, the effective theory is similar to a bilinear R-parity violating model. There are two sources for the neutrino masses: one is this bilinear R-parity breaking effect, and the other is the ordinary seesaw effect between left- and right-handed neutrinos. Combining these two effects, the hierarchical neutrino mass pattern arises even when the neutrino Yukawa matrices are not hierarchical. We acquire appropriate masses and mixings to explain both the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations.","created":"1999-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: singlet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass generation: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":50,"citation_count":76,"authors":["Kitano, Ryuichiro","Oda, Kin-ya"]}

{"title":"Gamma-ray bursts via emission of axion - like particles","abstract":"The Pseudo-Goldstone Boson (PGB) emission could provide a very efficient mechanism for explaining the cosmic Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). The PGBs could be produced during the merging of two compact objects like two neutron stars or neutron star - black hole, and then decay into electron-positron pairs and photons at distances ~ 100-1000 km. In this way, a huge energy (up to more than 10^{54} erg) can be deposited into the outer space with low baryon density in the form of ultrarelativistic e^+e^- plasma, the so called fireball, which originates the observed gamma-ray bursts. The needed ranges for the PGB parameters are: mass of order MeV, coupling to nucleons g_{aN} ~ few x 10^{-6} and to electrons g_{ae} ~ few x 10^{-9}. Interestingly enough, the range for coupling constants correspond to that of the invisible axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking scale V ~ few x 10^5 GeV, but the mass of the PGB is many orders of magnitude larger than what such a scale would demand to an axion. Neither present experimental data nor astrophysical and cosmological arguments can exclude such an ultramassive axion, however the relevant parameters' window is within the reach of future experiments. Another exciting point is that our mechanism could explain the association of some GRBs with supernovae type Ib/c, as far as their progenitor stars have a radius ~ 10^4 km. And finally, it also could help the supernova type II explosion: PGBs emitted from the core of the collapsing star and decaying in the outer shells would deposit a kinetic energy of the order of 10^{51} erg. In this way, emission of such an axion-like particle could provide an unique theoretical base for understanding the gamma ray bursts and supernova explosions.","created":"1999-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.80.Mz"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"98.70.Rz"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"97.60.-s"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Goldstone particle: emission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n: matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"black hole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Goldstone particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Goldstone particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"axion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supernova"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":49,"citation_count":34,"authors":["Berezhiani, Zurab","Drago, Alessandro"]}

{"title":"Many fold universe","abstract":"We propose that our world is a brane folded many times inside the sub-millimeter extra dimensions. The folding produces many connected parallel branes or folds with identical microphysics - a Manyfold. Nearby matter on other folds can be detected gravitationally as dark matter since the light it emits takes a long time to reach us traveling around the fold. Hence dark matter is microphysically identical to ordinary matter; it can dissipate and clump possibly forming dark replicas of ordinary stars which are good MACHO candidates. Its dissipation may lead to far more frequent occurrence of gravitational collapse and consequently to a significant enhancement in gravitational wave signals detectable by LIGO and LISA. Sterile neutrinos find a natural home on the other folds. Since the folded brane is not a BPS state, it gives a new geometric means for supersymmetry breaking in our world. It may also offer novel approach for the resolution of the cosmological horizon problem, although it still requires additional dynamics to solve the flatness problem. Although there are constraints from BBN, structure formation, the enormity of galactic halos and the absence of stars and globular clusters with a discernible dark matter component, we show that the model is consistent with current observational limits. It presents us with a new dark matter particle and a new framework for the evolution of structure in our universe.","created":"1999-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitational radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light nucleus: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"MACHO"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"horizon"}],"num_refs":67,"citation_count":69,"authors":["Arkani-Hamed, Nima","Dimopoulos, Savas","Dvali, G.R.","Kaloper, Nemanja"]}

We find that the expansion of our universe is generically in agreement with the expected effective four dimensional description. The constraint (which is responsible for the appearance of non-conventional cosmologies in these models) that must be imposed on the matter densities on the two branes in the theory without a stabilized radius is a consequence of requiring a static solution even in the absence of stabilization. Such constraints disappear in the presence of a stablizing potential, and the ordinary FRW (Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) equations are reproduced, with the expansion driven by the sum of the physical values of the energy densities on the two branes and in the bulk. For the case of the Randall-Sundrum model we examine the kinematics of the radion field, and find that corrections to the standard FRW equations are small for temperatures below the weak scale. We find that the radion field has renormalizable and unsuppressed couplings to Standard Model particles after electroweak symmetry breaking. These couplings may have important implications for collider searches. We comment on the possibility that matter off the TeV brane could serve as a dark matter candidate.","created":"1999-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":36,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model: compact"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"stability: radion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Einstein equation: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: Robertson-Walker"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"kinematics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: renormalizable"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":100,"citation_count":657,"authors":["Csaki, Csaba","Graesser, Michael","Randall, Lisa","Terning, John"]}

{"title":"When semantics turns to substance: Reformulating QCD analysis of F**gamma(2)(x,Q**2)","abstract":"QCD analysis of F_2^{\\gamma}(x,Q^2) is revisited. It is emphasized that the presence of the inhomogeneous term in the evolution equations for quark distribution functions of the photon implies important difference in the way factorization mechanism works in photon-hadron and photon-photon collisions as compared to the hadronic ones. Moreover, a careful definitions of the very concepts of the ``leading order'' and ``next-to-leading order'' QCD analysis of F_2^{\\gamma} are needed in order to separate genuine QCD effects from those of pure QED origin. After presenting such definitions, I show that all existing allegedly LO, as well as NLO analyses of F_2^{\\gamma}(x,Q^2) are incomplete. The source of this incompleteness of the conventional approach is traced back to the lack of clear identification of QCD effects and to the misinterpretation of the behaviour of q^{\\gamma}(x,M) as a function of \\alpha_s(M). Complete LO and NLO QCD analyses of F_2^{\\gamma}(x,Q^2) are shown to differ substantially from the conventional ones. Whereas complete NLO analysis requires the knowledge of two so far uncalculated quantities, a complete LO one is currently possible, but compared to the conventional formulation requires the inclusion of four known, but in the existing LO analyses unused quantities. The arguments recently advanced in favour of the conventional approach are analyzed and shown to contain a serious flaw. If corrected, they actually lends support to my claim.","created":"1999-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":25,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum electrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":24,"citation_count":23,"authors":["Chyla, J."]}

In the first case, we do not find vacua that are consistent with the constraints of gauge mediation and have a zero tree level cosmological constant. In the second case, no such conflict arises. In addition, by looking at the one loop cosmological constant, we show that the dilaton F -term can not be neglected in either case.

These models, realistic from a particle physics point of view, predict a broken-scale-invariant power spectrum of primordial cosmological perturbations, that may explain eventual nontrivial features in the present matter power spectrum. In previous works, the primordial spectrum was calculated using analytic slow-roll approximations. However, these models involve a fast second-order phase transition during inflation, with a stage of spinodal instability, and an interruption of slow-roll. For our previous model of double D-term inflation, we simulate numerically the evolution of quantum fluctuations, taking into account the spinodal modes, and we show that the semiclassical approximation can be employed even during the transition, due to the presence of a second inflaton field. The primordial power spectrum possesses a rich structure, and possibly, a non-Gaussian spike on observable scales.","created":"1999-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":40,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"98.80.Cq"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"04.62.+v"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"05.70.Fh"},{"source":"author","value":"Early universe"},{"source":"author","value":"Inflation"},{"source":"author","value":"Primordial fluctuations"},{"source":"author","value":"Phase transitions"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spectrum: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: semiclassical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation: Higgs"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":53,"citation_count":50,"authors":["Lesgourgues, Julien"]}

To deal with higher-loop diagrams, we present a general argument that the superficial degree of divergence of classical vertex functions decreases by one with each additional loop: one-loop contributions are superficially linearly divergent, two-loop contributions are superficially logarithmically divergent, and three- and higher-loop contributions are superficially finite.

We show analytically that in the Yukawa sector there is only one infra-red stable fixed point. This corresponds to non-trivial fixed point for the top-, bottom-quark Yukawa couplings and the $B$ violating coupling $\\lambda_{233}''$, and a trivial one for the $\\tau$-Yukawa coupling. All other possible fixed points are either unphysical or unstable in the infra-red region. We then carry out an analysis of the renormalization group equations for the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings, and determine the corresponding fixed points for these couplings. We also study the quasi-fixed point behaviour, both algebraically and with numerical solutions of the evolution equations, of the third generation Yukawa couplings and the baryon number violating coupling, and those of the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings. From the analysis of the fixed point behaviour, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the baryon number violating coupling $\\lambda_{233}''$, as well as on the supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings.","created":"1999-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"infrared problem: fixed point"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":25,"citation_count":5,"authors":["Ananthanarayan, B.","Pandita, P.N."]}

Both methods lead to identical results. We find that the standard PDFs fail to describe the experimental data below Q^2 < 7 GeV^2, which is much higher than for F_2^p and F_2^d separately. The difference between PDFs and the experimental data cannot be understood as due to nuclear effects in the deuteron, and evidently suggests substantial nonsinglet higher-twist effects. The trend of the experimental data is approximately explained by a recent two-component model of the nucleon structure functions and suggests strong Q^2-dependence of the Gottfried Sum, in disagreement with the parton model interpretation.

At leading order, the parallel- perpendicular asymmetry in azimuthal distributions of both charm and bottom quark is predicted to be about 20% in a wide region of initial energy. Our analysis shows that the next-to-leading order corrections practically do not affect the Born predictions for the azimuthal asymmetry at energies of the fixed target experiments. Both leading and next-to-leading order predictions for the asymmetry are insensitive to within few percent to theoretical uncertainties in the QCD input parameters: $m_{Q}$, $\\mu_{R}$, $\\mu_{F}$, $\\Lambda_{QCD}$ and in the gluon distribution function. We estimate also nonperturbative contributions to azimuthal distributions due to the gluon transverse motion in the target and the final quark fragmentation. Our calculations show that nonperturbative corrections to a $B$-meson azimuthal asymmetry are negligible. We conclude that measurements of the single spin asymmetry would provide a good test of pQCD applicability to heavy flavor production at fixed target energies.","created":"1999-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon nucleon: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: polarized beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: linear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charm"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon gluon: fusion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular distribution: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":14,"citation_count":19,"authors":["Ivanov, N.Ya.","Capella, A.","Kaidalov, A.B."]}

The renormalization of the chiral loops is discussed and relations among different decay amplitudes are derived. We find that chiral loops involving electromagnetic interactions of the light pseudoscalar mesons provide a sizable enhancement of these decay widths. Furthermore, we obtain an absolute prediction for the widths of Xi^{0'(*)}_c--> Xi^{0}_c gamma and Xi^{-'(*)}_b--> Xi^{-}_b gamma.

We found that: 1) a nondiagonal mass term characterising oscillations is the width of two particle transitions into each other (this width can be computed by the standard method); 2) two types of oscillations take place: real and virtual. Solution of the problem of origin of mixing angle in the theory of vacuum oscillations is given. It is shown that neutral K meson and neutrino oscillations must proceed via two stages. First, neutral K^{o}, antineutral K-eigenstates of strong interaction (or nu(e), nu(mu), nu(tau) eigenstates of weak interactions) are created. Then, owing to the presence of the strangeness violating weak interaction (or the lepton number violating interactions), these meson states (or neutrino states) are converted into superpositions of neutral K(1) and neutral K(2)-eigenstates of the weak interaction violating strangeness (or nu(1), nu(2), nu(3)-eigenstates of the interaction-violating lepton numbers).

{"title":"Dynamics of symmetry breaking in FRW cosmologies: Emergence of scaling","abstract":"The dynamics of a symmetry breaking phase transition is studied in a radiation and matter dominated spatially flat FRW cosmology in the large N limit of a scalar field theory.The quantum density matrix is evolved from an initial state of quasiparticles in thermal equilibrium at a temperature higher than the critical. The cosmological expansion decreases the temperature and triggers the phase transition. We identify three different time scales: an early regime dominated by linear instabilities and the exponential growth of long-wavelength fluctuations,an intermediate scale when the field fluctuations probe the broken symmetry states and an asymptotic scale wherein a scaling regime emerges for modes of wavelength comparable to or larger than the horizon.The scaling regime is characterized by a dynamical physical correlation length xi_{phys} = d_H(t) with d_H(t) the size of the causal horizon, thus there is one correlated region per causal horizon. Inside these correlated regions the field fluctuations sample the broken symmetry states. The amplitude of the long-wavelength fluctuations becomes non-perturbatively large due to the early times instabilities and a semiclassical but stochastic description emerges in the asymptotic regime. In the scaling regime, the power spectrum is peaked at zero momentum revealing the onset of a Bose-Einstein condensate.The scaling solution results in that the equation of state of the scalar fields is the same as that of the background fluid. This implies a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum of scalar density perturbations for long-wavelengths. We discuss the corrections to scaling as well as the universality of the scaling solution and the differences and similarities with the classical non-linear sigma model.","created":"1999-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":39,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Friedman model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: Robertson-Walker"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dynamical symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation: length"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spectrum: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sigma model: nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: O(N)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":46,"citation_count":10,"authors":["Boyanovsky, D.","de Vega, H.J."]}

Such equations are ambiguous, and depend on the details of one's convention for discretizing time when solving them. I show that these ambiguities are uniquely resolved if the system has a known equilibrium distribution exp[-V(q)/T] and if, at some more fundamental level, the physics of the system is reversible. I also discuss a simple example where this happens, which is the small frequency limit of Newton's equation d^2q/dt^2 + e^2(q) dq/dt = - grad V(q) + e^{-1}(q) xi with noise and a q-dependent damping term. The resolution does not correspond to simply interpreting naive continuum equations in a standard convention, such as Stratanovich or Ito.

The definition of the path integral depends crucially on the convention used for discretizing time, and I specifically derive the correct path integral when the convention used is the natural, time-symmetric one that time derivatives are (q_t - q_{t-\\Delta t}) / \\Delta t and coordinates are (q_t + q_{t-\\Delta t}) / 2. [This is the convention that permits standard manipulations of calculus on the action, like naive integration by parts.] It has sometimes been assumed in the literature that a Stratanovich Langevin equation can be quickly converted to a path integral by treating time as continuous but using the rule \\theta(t=0) = 1/2.

The mean-field coupled time-dependent Schroedinger equations for the modes of the scalar field are derived and the suitable procedure to renormalize them is outlined. A further controlled gaussian approximation of our tdHF approach is used in order to study the dynamical evolution of the system from non-equilibrium initial conditions characterized by a uniform condensate. We find that, during the slow rolling down, the long-wavelength quantum fluctuations do not grow to a macroscopic size but do scale with the linear size of the system, in accordance with similar results valid for the large $N$ approximation of the O(N) model. This behavior undermines in a precise way the gaussian approximation within our tdHF approach, which therefore appears as a viable mean to correct an unlikely feature of the standard HF factorization scheme, such as the so-called ``stopping at the spinodal line'' of the quantum fluctuations. We also study the dynamics of the system in infinite volume with particular attention to the asymptotic evolution in the broken symmetry phase. We are able to show that the fixed points of the evolution cover at most the classically metastable part of the static effective potential.","created":"2000-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":34,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"phi**n model: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Hamiltonian formalism"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Hartree-Fock approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":20,"citation_count":14,"authors":["Destri, C.","Manfredini, E."]}

For most field theories, the Lipatov asymptotics has the functional form c a^N \\Gamma(N+b) (N is the order of perturbation theory), and the relative corrections to it have a form of a series in powers of 1/N. It is shown that this series diverges factorially and its high-order coefficients can be calculated using a procedure similar to Lipatov's one. The K-th expansion coefficient has the form const(\\ln(S1/S0))^{-K}\\Gamma(K+(r1-r0)/2), where S0 and S1 are the values of the action for the first and the second instanton of the field theory under consideration, while r0 and r1 are the corresponding numbers of zero modes.

{"title":"Asymptotic scaling of the gluon propagator on the lattice","abstract":"We pursue the study of the high energy behaviour of the gluon propagator on the lattice in the Landau gauge in the flavorless case (n_f=0).

Our present high statistics analysis includes also a simulation at $\\beta=6.8$ ($a\\simeq 0.03$ fm), which allows to reach $\\mu \\simeq 10$ GeV. Special care has been devoted to the finite lattice-spacing artifacts as well as to the finite volume effects, the latter being acute at $\\beta=6.8$ where the volume is bounded by technical limits. Our main conclusion is a strong evidence that the gluon propagator has reached three-loop asymptotic scaling, at $\\mu$ ranging from 5.6 GeV to 9.5 GeV. We buttress up this conclusion on several demanding criteria of asymptoticity, including scheme independence. Our fit in the 5.6 GeV to 9.5 GeV window yields $\\Lambda^{\\bar{{\\rm MS}}} = 319 \\pm 14 ^{+10}_{-20}$ MeV, in good agreement with our previous result, $\\Lambda^{\\bar{{\\rm MS}}} = 295 \\pm 20 $ MeV, obtained from the three gluon vertex, but it is significantly above the Schr\\\"odinger functional method estimate : $238 \\pm 19$ MeV.

In the case of a self-coupling inflaton potential $V(\\phi)=\\lambda \\phi^4/4$, the dynamics of preheating changes by the effect of the negative $\\xi$. We find that the nonminimal coupling works in two ways. First, since the initial value of inflaton field for reheating becomes smaller with the increase of $|\\xi|$, the evolution of the inflaton quanta is delayed for fixed $\\lambda$. Second, the oscillation of the inflaton field is modified and the nonadiabatic change around $\\phi=0$ occurs significantly. That makes the resonant band of the fluctuation field wider. Especially for strong coupling regimes $|\\xi| \\gg 1$, the growth of the inflaton flutuation is dominated by the resonance due to the nonminimal coupling, which leads to the significant enhancement of low momentum modes. Although the final variance of the inflaton fluctuation does notchange significantly compared with the minimally coupled case, we have found that the energy transfer from the homogeneous inflaton to created particles efficiently occurs for $\\xi<-60$.","created":"1999-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflaton: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"preheating"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflaton: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: strong coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":57,"citation_count":38,"authors":["Tsujikawa, Shinji","Maeda, Kei-ichi","Torii, Takashi"]}

We conclude that the experimental data suggest large deviation of the value of the matrix element of Q_6 from the vacuum-saturation approximation, possibly due to penguin contractions.","created":"1999-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":30,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.30.Er"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.15.Hh"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.25.Es"},{"source":"author","value":"CKM matrix elements"},{"source":"author","value":"K decays"},{"source":"author","value":"CP violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CKM matrix: unitarity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K --> 2pi"}],"num_refs":76,"citation_count":64,"authors":["Ciuchini, Marco","Franco, E.","Giusti, Leonardo","Lubicz, V.","Martinelli, G."]}
{"title":"A Method for extracting cos alpha","abstract":"We show that it is possible to extract the weak mixing angle alpha via a measurement of the rate for B^+(-) -> \\pi^+(-) e^+e^-. The sensitivity to cos(alpha) results from the interference between the long and short distance contributions. The short distance contribution can be computed, using heavy quark symmetry, in terms of semi-leptonic form factors. More importantly, we show that, using Ward identities and a short distance operator product expansion, the long distance contribution can be calculated without recourse to light cone wave functions when the invariant mass of the lepton pair, q^2, is much larger than LQCDs. We find that for q^2 > 2 GeV^2 the branching fraction is approximately 1 * 10^{-8}|V_{td}/0.008|^2. The shape of the differential rate is very sensitive to the value of cos(alpha) at small values of q^2 with dGamma /dq^2 varying up to 50% in the interval -1< cos(alpha)< 1 at q^2= 2 GeV^2.

We show that at most a small fraction of the magnetic field is expelled, and if the screening distance is the smallest length scale in the problem there is no expulsion at all. We calculate the behavior of the magnetic field for a spherical geometry relevant for compact stars. If a neutron star contains a quark matter core, this core is a color superconductor.

{"title":"Implications of recent measurements of hadronic charmless B decays","abstract":"Implications of recent CLEO measurements of hadronic charmless B decays are discussed.

(ii) The tree-dominated modes $B\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-, \\rho^0\\pi^\\pm, \\omega\\pi^\\pm$ imply that the effective number of colors N_c(LL) for (V-A)(V-A) operators is preferred to be smaller, while the current limit on $B\\to\\phi K$ shows that N_c(LR)>3.

{"title":"Renormalization and running of quark mass and field in the regularization invariant and MS-bar schemes at three loops and four loops","abstract":"We derive explicit transformation formulae relating the renormalized quark mass and field as defined in the MS-bar scheme with the corresponding quantities defined in any other scheme. By analytically computing the three-loop quark propagator in the high-energy limit (that is keeping only massless terms and terms of first order in the quark mass) we find the NNNLO conversion factors transforming the MS-bar quark mass and the renormalized quark field to those defined in a ``Regularization Invariant'' (RI) scheme which is more suitable for lattice QCD calculations. The NNNLO contribution in the mass conversion factor turns out to be large and comparable to the previous NNLO contribution at a scale of 2 GeV --- the typical normalization scale employed in lattice simulations. Thus, in order to get a precise prediction for the MS-bar masses of the light quarks from lattice calculations the latter should use a somewhat higher scale of around, say, 3 GeV where the (apparent) convergence of the perturbative series for the mass conversion factor is better. We also compute two more terms in the high-energy expansion of the MS-bar renormalized quark propagator. The result is then used to discuss the uncertainty caused by the use of the high energy limit in determining the MS-bar mass of the charmed quark. As a by-product of our calculations we determine the four-loop anomalous dimensions of the quark mass and field in the Regularization Invariant scheme. Finally, we discuss some physical reasons lying behind the striking absence of zeta(4) in these computed anomalous dimensions.","created":"1999-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"12.38.B"},{"source":"author","value":"12.38.C"},{"source":"author","value":"12.38.G"},{"source":"author","value":"12.15.F"},{"source":"author","value":"Quantum chromodynamics"},{"source":"author","value":"Lattice QCD calculations"},{"source":"author","value":"Perturbation theory"},{"source":"author","value":"Quark masses"},{"source":"author","value":"Anomalous dimensions"},{"source":"author","value":"Scheme dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"higher-order: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"higher-order: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":58,"citation_count":238,"authors":["Chetyrkin, K.G.","Retey, A."]}

This work provides a microscopic field-theoretical basis to the ``effective kinetic theory'' proposed by Jeon and Yaffe [S. Jeon and L. G. Yaffe, Phys. Rev. D53, 5799 (1996)], while our result for the bulk viscosity reproduces their expression derived from linear response theory and the imaginary-time formalism of thermal field theory. Though unavoidably involved in calculations of this sort, we feel that the approach using fundamental quantum kinetic field theory is conceptually clearer and methodically simpler than the effective kinetic theory approach, as the success of the latter requires clever rendition of diagrammatic resummations which is neither straightforward nor failsafe. Moreover, the method based on the CTP-2PI effective action illustrated here for a scalar field can be formulated entirely in terms of functional integral quantization, which makes it an appealing method for a first-principles calculation of transport functions of a thermal non-abelian gauge theory, e.g., QCD quark-gluon plasma produced from heavy ion collisions.","created":"1999-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":25,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hydrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"higher-order: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tensor: energy-momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"entropy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transport theory"}],"num_refs":46,"citation_count":52,"authors":["Calzetta, E.A.","Hu, B.L.","Ramsey, S.A."]}

These effects are important for the high precision objectives of the Next Linear Collider. We use the infrared evolution equation, based on a gauge invariant dispersive method, to obtain double logarithmic asymptotics of scattering amplitudes and discuss how it can be applied, in the case of broken gauge symmetry, to the Standard Model of electroweak processes. We discuss the double logarithmic effects to both non-radiative processes and to processes accompanied by soft gauge boson emission. In all cases the Sudakov double logarithms are found to exponentiate.

We show that the viscosity can be obtained as the integral of a three-point function. Non-perturbative corrections to the bare one-loop result can be obtained by solving a decoupled Schwinger-Dyson type integral equation for this vertex. This integral equation represents the resummation of an infinite series of ladder diagrams which contribute to the leading order result. It can be shown that this integral equation has exactly the same form as the Boltzmann equation. We show that the integral equation for the viscosity can be reexpressed by writing the vertex as a combination of polarization tensors. An expression for this polarization tensor can be obtained by solving another Schwinger-Dyson type integral equation. This procedure results in an expression for the viscosity that represents a non-perturbative resummation of contributions to the viscosity which includes certain non-ladder graphs, as well as the usual ladders. We discuss the motivation for this resummation. We show that these resummations can also be obtained by writing the viscosity as an integral equation involving a single four-point function. Finally, we show that when the viscosity is expressed in terms of a four-point function, it is possible to further extend the set of graphs included in the resummation by treating vertex and propagator corrections self-consistently. We discuss the significance of such a self-consistent resummation and show that the integral equation contains cancellations between vertex and propagator corrections.","created":"1999-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":42,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"phi**n model: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion: weak coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"viscosity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"integral equations: decoupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dyson-Schwinger equation: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"ladder approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: tensor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n-point function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Boltzmann equation"}],"num_refs":26,"citation_count":50,"authors":["Carrington, M.E.","Hou, De-fu","Kobes, R."]}

In weak coupling and to leading logarithm accuracy, the pairing energies can be estimated exactly. For a small number of colors, the BCS effect overtakes the Overhauser effect, while for a large number of colors the opposite takes place, in agreement with a recent renormalization group argument. In strong coupling with large pairing energies, the Overhauser effect may be dominant for any number of colors, suggesting that QCD may crystallize into an insulator at a few times nuclear matter density, a situation reminiscent of dense Skyrmions. The Overhauser effect is dominant in QCD in 1+1 dimensions, although susceptible to quantum effects.

Previously, models of this type were applied to pi pi and pi K scattering and were seen to require the existence of light scalar sigma(560) and kappa(900) mesons and to be consistent with the f0(980). The present calculation extends this to include the a0(980), thereby completing a possible nonet of light scalars, all ``seen'' in the same manner. We note that, at the initial level, the pi eta channel is considerably cleaner than the pi pi and pi K channels for the study of light scalars. This is because the large competing effects of vector meson exchange and ``current-algebra'' contact terms are absent. The simplicity of this channel enables us to demonstrate the closeness of our exactly crossing symmetric amplitude to a related exactly unitary amplitude. The calculation is also extended to higher energies in order to let us discuss the role played by the a0(1450) resonance.","created":"1999-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":29,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson meson: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"eta"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tree approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar meson: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"f0(600)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: kappa(900)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"f0(980)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"a0(980)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"amplitude analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partial wave analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"S-matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unitarity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: crossing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson meson: inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":55,"citation_count":57,"authors":["Black, Deirdre","Fariborz, Amir H.","Schechter, Joseph"]}

{"title":"Dynamics of nontopological solitons: Q balls","abstract":"We use numerical simulations and semi-analytical methods to investigate the stability and the interactions of nontopological stationary qball solutions. In the context of a simple model we map the parameter sectors of stability for a single qball and verify the result using numerical simulations of time evolution. The system of two interacting qballs is also studied in one and two space dimensions. We find that the system generically performs breather type oscillations with frequency equal to the difference of the internal qball frequencies. This result is shown to be consistent with the form of the qball interaction potential. Finally we perform simulations of qball scattering and show that the right angle scattering effect observed in topological soliton scattering in two dimensions, persists also in the case of qballs where no topologically conserved quantities are present.

{"title":"Gravity, parametric resonance and chaotic inflation","abstract":"We investigate the possibility that nonlinear gravitational effects influence the preheating era after inflation. Our work is based on numerical solutions of the inhomogeneous Einstein field equations, and is free of perturbative approximations. The one restriction we impose is to limit the inhomogeneity to a single spatial direction. We compare our results to perturbative calculations and to solutions of the nonlinear field equations in a rigid (unperturbed) spacetime, in order to isolate gravitational phenomena. We consider two types of initial conditions: where only one mode of the field perturbation has a non-zero initial amplitude, and where all the modes begin with a non-zero amplitude. Here we focus on preheating following inflation driven by a scalar field with a quartic potential. We confirm the broad picture of preheating obtained from the nonlinear field equations in a rigid background, but gravitational effects have a measurable impact on the dynamics for both sets of initial data. The rigid spacetime results predict that the amplitude of a single initially excited mode drops rapidly after resonance ends, whereas in the relativistic case the amplitude is roughly constant. With all modes initially excited, the longest modes in the simulation grow much more rapidly in the relativistic calculation than with a rigid background. However, we see no evidence for the sort of gravitational collapse associated with the formation of primordial black holes. The numerical codes described here are easily extended to more complicated resonant models, which we will examine in the future.","created":"1999-10-25T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":15,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"chaos"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Einstein equation: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spectrum: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"amplitude analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"resonance: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"phi**n model: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"preheating"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boundary condition"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":40,"citation_count":54,"authors":["Easther, Richard","Parry, Matthew"]}

{"title":"Spontaneous violation of the CP symmetry in the Higgs sector of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric model","abstract":"The spontaneous violation of the CP symmetry in the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard Model (NMSSM) is investigated. It is found that the spontaneous violation of the CP symmetry can occur in the Higgs sector of the NMSSM for a wide region of the parameter space of the model, at the 1-loop level where the radiative corrections due to the top quark and scalar-top quark loops are found to generate the scalar-pseudoscalar mixings between the two Higgs doublets of the NMSSM. In our model, we assume that the masses of the left-handed and the right-handed scalar-top quarks are not degenerate. And we investigate our model anaytically: We derive analytical formulae of the 1-loop mass matrix for the neutral Higgs bosons. We calculate the upper bound on the lightest neutral Higgs boson mass under the assumption. It is found to be about 140 GeV for our choice of parameter values in the presence of the spontaneous violation of the CP symmetry in the NMSSM. Thus, the possibility of the spontaneous violation of the CP symmetry is not completely ruled out in the Higgs sector of the NMSSM if the masses of the left-handed and the right-handed scalar-top quarks are not degenerate. Further, the phenomenology of the $K$-${\\bar K}$ mixing within the context of our model is studied.

{"title":"On the scaling behavior of the cosmological constant and the possible existence of new forces and new light degrees of freedom","abstract":"A large value of the cosmological constant (CC) is induced in the Standard Model (SM) of Elementary Particle Physics because of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking. To provide a small value of the observable CC one has to introduce the vacuum term which cancels the induced one at some point in the very far infrared cosmic scale. Starting from this point we investigate whether the cancellation is preserved at different energy scales. We find that the running of the Higgs mass, couplings and the vacuum term inevitably result in a scaling dependence of the observable CC value. As a consequence one meets a nonzero CC at an energy scale comparable to the typical electron neutrino mass suggested by some experiments, and the order of magnitude of this constant is roughly the one derived from recent supernovae observations. However the sign of it is negative -- opposite to what is suggested by these observations. This discrepancy may be a hint of the existence of an extra very light scalar, perhaps a Cosmon-like dilaton, which should essentially decouple from the SM Lagrangian, but that it nevertheless could mediate new macroscopic forces in the submillimeter range.","created":"1999-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"new interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: postulated particle"}],"num_refs":19,"citation_count":237,"authors":["Shapiro, Ilya L.","Sola, Joan"]}

{"title":"Can multi - TeV (top and other) squarks be natural in gauge mediation?","abstract":"We investigate whether multi-TeV (1-3 TeV) squarks can be natural in models of gauge mediated SUSY breaking. The idea is that for some boundary condition of the scalar (Higgs and stop) masses, the Higgs (mass)$^2$, evaluated at the renormalization scale $\\sim O(100)$ GeV, is not very sensitive to (boundary values of) the scalar masses (this has been called ``focussing'' in recent literature). Then, the stop masses can be multi-TeV without leading to fine-tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking. {\\em Minimal} gauge mediation does {\\em not} lead to this focussing (for all values of $\\tan \\beta$ and the messenger scale): the (boundary value of) the Higgs mass is too small compared to the stop masses. Also, in minimal gauge mediation, the gaugino masses are of the same order as the scalar masses so that multi-TeV scalars implies multi-TeV gauginos (especially gluino) leading to fine-tuning. We discuss ideas to {\\em increase} the Higgs mass relative to the stop masses (so that focussing can be achieved) and also to {\\em suppress} gaugino masses relative to scalar masses (or to modify the gaugino mass relations) in {\\em non-minimal} models of gauge mediation -- then multi-TeV (top and other) squarks can be natural. Specific models of gauge mediation which incorporate these ideas and thus have squarks (and in some cases, the gluino) heavier than a TeV without resulting in fine-tuning are also studied and their collider signals are contrasted with those of other models which have multi-TeV squarks.","created":"1999-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: minimal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gaugino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"messenger"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":26,"citation_count":29,"authors":["Agashe, Kaustubh"]}
{"title":"Cosmological expansion in the Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario","abstract":"The cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum scenario for a positive tension brane in a 5-D Universe with localized gravity has been studied previously. In the radiation-dominated Universe, it was suggested that there are two solutions for the cosmic scale factor a(t) : the standard solution $a\\sim t^{1/2}$, and a solution $a\\sim t^{1/4}$, which is incompatible with standard big bang nucleosynthesis. In this note, we reconsider expansion of the Universe in this scenario. We derive and solve a first order, linear differential equation for H^2, the square of the expansion rate of the Universe, as a function of a. The differences between our equation for H^2 and the relationship found in standard cosmology are (i) there is a term proportional to density squared (a fact already known), which is small when the density is small compared to the brane tension, and (ii) there is a contribution which acts like a relativistic fluid. We show that this second contribution is due to gravitational degrees of freedom in the bulk. Thus, we find that there need not be any conflict between cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum scenario and the standard model of cosmology. We discuss how reheating at the end of inflation leads to the correct relationship between matter density and expansion rate, $H^2\\to 8\\pi G\\rho_m/3$, and the conditions that must be met for the expansion rate of the Universe to be close to its standard model value around the epoch of cosmological nucleosynthesis.","created":"1999-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential equations: linear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential equations: solution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitational radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fluid: relativistic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: expansion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decoupling"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":265,"authors":["Flanagan, Eanna E.","Tye, S.H.Henry","Wasserman, Ira"]}

They have nonsinglet representations which seem particularly suitable for distinguishing the lighter generations from the heavier ones. Also, they do not suffer from the extra constraints a continuous group must obey, e.g. limits on extra particles. Some of the simplest groups are the nonabelian discrete subgroups of SO(3) and SU(2), the so called dihedral groups D_n and dicyclic groups Q_2n, which both have only singlet and doublet representations. After studying which vacuum expectation value (VEV) directions of representations of dihedral and dicyclic groups preserve which subgroups, we construct a simple model based on the group Q_6 \\times Q_6. The model reproduces the masses and mixings of all quarks and leptons, including neutrinos. It has a large mixing angle in the mu - tau neutrino sector, in accordance with the recent SuperKamiokande results, while keeping a small quark mixing in the bottom - charm sector. The reason is similar to the one found in the literature based on the SU(5) group: the large_left_ handed mixing angle in the lepton sector corresponds to the large unphysical_right_ handed in the down quark sector. The large mixing is also responsible for the different hierarchies of the two heaviest families in the up and down sector, and can be summarized as the order of magnitude relation: m_s/m_b \\sim tan(theta_\\mu\\tau) \\sqrt{m_c/m_t}","created":"1999-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: texture"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: discrete"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SO(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"group theory: representation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mixing angle: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":51,"citation_count":69,"authors":["Frampton, Paul H.","Rasin, Andrija"]}

We illustrate these results for MSSM with radiative electro-weak symmetry breaking constraints. We also discuss a class of D brane models based on Type IIB superstring compactifications which have non-universal phases in the gaugino mass sector and allow large CP violating phases consistent with the EDM constraints through the cancellation mechanism.

We identify two principal sources responsible for the enhancement of A0/A_2: the vertex-type as well as penguin-type corrections to the matrix elements of four-quark operators, which render the physical amplitude renormalization-scale and -scheme independent, and the nonfactorized effect due to soft-gluon exchange, which is needed to suppress the $\\Delta I=3/2$ $K\\to\\pi\\pi$ amplitude. Contrary to the chiral approach which is limited to light meson decays and fails to reproduce the A2 amplitude, the aforementioned approach for dealing with scheme and scale issues is applicable to heavy meson decays. We obtain A0/A2=13-15 if $m_s$(1 GeV) lies in the range (125-175)MeV. The bag parameters $B_i$, which are often employed to parametrize the scale and scheme dependence of hadronic matrix elements, are calculated in two different renormalization scehemes. It is found that $B_8^{(2)}$ and $ B_6^{(0)}$, both of order 1.5 at $\\mu=1$ GeV, are nearly $\\gamma_5$ scheme independent, whereas $B^{(0)}_{3,5,7}$ as well as $B_7^{(2)}$ show a sizable scheme dependence.

This calculation provides the complete O(alpha_w alpha_s) and O(alpha_w alpha_s sin^2 theta_w m_t^2) corrections (alpha_w = alpha/sin^2 theta_w) to the Wilson coefficients of the electroweak penguin four quark operators relevant for non-leptonic K- and B-decays. We argue that this is the dominant part of the next-next-to-leading (NNLO) contributions to these coefficients. Our results allow to reduce considerably the uncertainty due to the definition of the top quark mass present in the existing NLO calculations of non-leptonic decays. The NNLO corrections to the coefficient of the color singlet (V-A)x(V-A) electroweak penguin operator Q_9 relevant for B-decays are generally moderate, amount to a few percent for the choice m_t(mu_t = m_t) and depend only weakly on the renormalization scheme. Larger NNLO corrections with substantial scheme dependence are found for the coefficients of the remaining electroweak penguin operators Q_7, Q_8 and Q_10. In particular, the strong scheme dependence of the NNLO corrections to C_8 allows to reduce considerably the scheme dependence of C_8 (Q_8)_2 relevant for the ratio epsilon'/epsilon.","created":"1999-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":38,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K0(L): hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"selection rule: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: penguin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z0: penguin"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"selection rule: strangeness"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator product expansion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization: dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: octet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K0(L) --> 2pi"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B --> K pi"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B/s --> Phi(1020) pi"}],"num_refs":41,"citation_count":77,"authors":["Buras, Andrzej J.","Gambino, Paolo","Haisch, Ulrich A."]}

The requirement of momentum conservation is always satisfied. The residual ambiguity on the splitting functions is effectively parameterized in terms of the value of lambda, which fixes the small x asymptotic behaviour x^-lambda of the singlet parton distributions.

The freedom is used to give the phenomenologically correct mass matrices all kind of different forms and this is one of the reasons for the proliferation of models for the fermionic masses. The SM must be however extended and in most extensions, RH currents appear at higher energy scales. At those energies the RH rotations are not irrelevant any more, they can affect neutrino oscillations, proton decay, baryon assymetry, R-parity violating interactions etc. We study possible implications of large RH mixing in GUTs. Those are interesting not only because large mixing induce large effects. They are intimately related to large lepton mixing in GUTs, via a relation between LH mixing of the leptons and the RH ones of the d-quarks ,(``$d - \\ell$ duality'') and can change considerably the branching ratios of proton decay. Observation of proton decay channels as well as neutrino oscillations will teach us about RH rotations and will reduce, therefore, considerably the freedom in the fermionic mass matrices. Some interesting examples are studied in detail.

Special emphasis is put on potential signals of (partial) restoration of dynamically broken chiral symmetry in a hot and dense hadronic medium. It follows from chiral symmetry alone that parity partners of hadronic correlation functions must become identical when the symmetry is restored. The assessment of medium effects in the vector channel, which governs the dilepton production, thus necessitates a simultaneous treatment of the vector and axialvector degrees of freedom. While significant progress in this respect has been made some open questions remain in establishing a rigorous link in the mass region below 1 GeV. From the present calculations a suggestive 'quark-hadron duality' emerges near the phase boundary. It implies substantial medium effects in the dilepton signal from the hadronic phase which smoothly matches a perturbative description within the plasma phase.","created":"1999-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":164,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"inspirereview:V-d-2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"review"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum: dilepton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lattice field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sum rule"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear reaction: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: direct production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":292,"citation_count":849,"authors":["Rapp, R.","Wambach, J."]}

States with masses not much larger than this should be observable at the LHC. However, even for first excitation masses close to this lower bound, the second set of excitations will be too heavy to be produced thus eliminating the possibility of realizing the cleanest signature for KK scenarios. Previous studies of heavy $Z'$ and $W'$ production in this mass range at the LHC have demonstrated that very little information can be obtained about their couplings to the conventional fermions given the limited available statistics and imply that the LHC cannot distinguish an ordinary $Z'$ from the degenerate pair of the first KK excitations of the $\\gamma$ and $Z$. In this paper we discuss the capability of lepton colliders with center of mass energies significantly below the excitation mass to resolve this ambiguity. In addition, we examine how direct measurements obtained on and near the top of the first excitation peak at lepton colliders can confirm these results. For more than one extra dimension we demonstrate that it is likely that the first KK excitation is too massive to be produced at the LHC.","created":"1999-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":36,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: excited state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lower limit"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z': mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":144,"citation_count":134,"authors":["Rizzo, Thomas G."]}

{"title":"Confronting electroweak precision measurements with new physics models","abstract":"Precision experiments, such as those performed at LEP and SLC, offer us an excellent opportunity to constrain extended gauge model parameters. To this end, it is often assumed, that in order to obtain more reliable estimates, one should include the sizable one--loop Standard Model (SM) corrections, which modify the $Z^0$ couplings as well as other observables. This conviction is based on the belief that the higher order contributions from the ``extension sector'' will be numerically small. However, the structure of higher order corrections can be quite different when comparing the SM with its extension, thus one should avoid assumptions which do not care about such facts. This is the case for all models with $\\rho_{\\rm tree} \\equiv M_W^2/(M_{Z}^2\\cos^2{\\Theta_W}) \\neq 1$. As an example, both the manifest left-right symmetric model and the $SU(2)_L \\otimes U(1)_Y \\otimes \\tilde{U}(1)$ model, with an additional $Z'$ boson, are discussed and special attention to the top contribution to $\\Delta \\rho$ is given. We conclude that the only sensible way to confront a model with the experimental data is to renormalize it self-consistently, if not, parameters which depend strongly on quantum effects should be left free in fits, though essential physics is lost in this way. We should note that arguments given here allow us to state that at the level of loop corrections (indirect effects) there is nothing like a ``model independent global analysis'' of the data.","created":"1999-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: rho parameter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiative correction: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: left-right"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z'"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator: renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":53,"citation_count":48,"authors":["Czakon, M.","Gluza, J.","Jegerlehner, F.","Zralek, M."]}

{"title":"Massive higher dimensional gauge fields as messengers of supersymmetry breaking","abstract":"We consider theories with one or more compact dimensions with size r > 1/M, where M is the fundamental Planck scale, with the visible and hidden sectors localized on spatially separated \"3-branes.\" We show that a bulk U(1) gauge field spontaneously broken on the hidden-sector 3-brane is an attractive candidate for the messenger of supersymmetry breaking. In this scenario scalar mass-squared terms are proportional to U(1) charges, and therefore naturally conserve flavor. Arbitrary flavor violation at the Planck scale gives rise to exponentially suppressed flavor violation at low energies. Gaugino masses can be generated if the standard gauge fields propagate in the bulk; \\mu and B\\mu terms can be generated by the Giudice-Masiero or by the VEV of a singlet in the visible sector. The latter case naturally solves the SUSY CP problem. Realistic phenomenology can be obtained either if all microscopic parameters are order one in units of M, or if the theory is strongly coupled at the scale M. (For the latter case, we estimate parameters by extending \"naive dimensional analysis\" to higher-dimension theories with branes.) In either case, the only unexplained hierarchy is the \"large\" size of the extra dimensions in fundamental units, which need only be an order of magnitude. All soft masses are naturally within an order of magnitude of m_{3/2}, and trilinear scalar couplings are negligible. Squark and slepton masses can naturally unify even in the absence of grand unification.","created":"1999-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":25,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"messenger"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"violation: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gaugino: mass generation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"slepton: mass"}],"num_refs":37,"citation_count":172,"authors":["Chacko, Z.","Luty, Markus A.","Ponton, Eduardo"]}

There exists a renormalization group invariant parameter $\\delta$ that determines which of the condensates exist in the vacuum. At finite temperatures and densities, we map out the phase structure of the model by a detailed numerical analysis of the renormalized effective potential.

We show that the ${BR}(B\\to X_{s} \\gamma)$ constraint, though CP conserving, forces a negative answer to the above question. This implies that, even in the regions of the CMSSM where a cancellation of different contributions to the EDM allows for large SUSY phases, it is not possible to exploit the SUSY phases to fully account for observable CP violation. Hence to have sizeable SUSY contributions to CP violation, one needs new flavor structures in the sfermion mass matrices beyond the usual CKM matrix.","created":"1999-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mixing angle: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K0 anti-K0: mixing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B0 anti-B0: mixing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"beauty --> strangeness photon"}],"num_refs":32,"citation_count":61,"authors":["Demir, Durmus A.","Masiero, A.","Vives, O."]}

However, generating flavor at the TeV scale while avoiding flavor-changing difficulties appears prohibitively difficult at first sight. We argue to the contrary that this picture allows us to lower flavor physics close to the TeV scale. Small Yukawa couplings are generated by ``shining'' badly broken flavor symmetries from distant branes, and flavor and CP-violating processes are adequately suppressed by these symmetries. We further show how the extra dimensions avoid four dimensional disasters associated with light fields charged under flavor. We construct elegant and realistic theories of flavor based on the maximal U(3)^5 flavor symmetry which naturally generate the simultaneous hierarchy of masses and mixing angles. Finally, we introduce a new framework for predictive theories of flavor, where our 3-brane is embedded within highly symmetrical configurations of higher-dimensional branes.","created":"1999-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":40,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: U(3)**5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: flavor changing"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":83,"authors":["Arkani-Hamed, Nima","Hall, Lawrence J.","Tucker-Smith, David","Weiner, Neal"]}

Maximum field variances are strongly underestimated if metric perturbations are ignored. We illustrate this in the case of strong self-interaction of the decay products. Without metric perturbations, preheating in this case is very inefficient. However, metric perturbations increase the maximum field variances and give alternative channels for the resonance to proceed. This implies that metric perturbations can have a large impact on calculations of relic abundances of particles produced during preheating.","created":"1999-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":6,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"invariance: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"back reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: inflaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"resonance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":49,"citation_count":110,"authors":["Bassett, Bruce A.","Viniegra, Fermin"]}

{"title":"Large parity violating effects in atomic dysprosium with nearly degenerate Floquet eigenvalues","abstract":"In this article we study effects of parity nonconservation in atomic dysprosium, where one has a pair of nearly degenerate levels of opposite parity. We consider the time evolution of this two-level system within oscillatory electric and magnetic fields. These are chosen to have a periodical structure with the same period, such that a Floquet matrix describes the time evolution of the quantum states. We show that, if the states are unstable, the eigenvalues of the Floquet matrix may have contributions proportional to the square root of the parity violating interaction matrix element $H_w$ while they are almost degenerate in their parity even part. This leads to beat frequencies proportional to $\\sqrt{H_w}$ which are expected to be larger by several orders of magnitude compared to ordinary P-violating contributions which are of order $H_w$. However, for the simple field configurations we considered, it still seems to be difficult to observe these P-violating beat effects, since the states decay too fast. On the other hand, we found that, within only a few Floquet cycles, very large parity violating asymmetries with respect to experimental setups of opposite chirality may be obtained. The electric and magnetic fields as well as the time intervals necessary for this are in an experimentally accessible range. For statistically significant effects beyond one standard deviation a number of about $10^7$ atoms is required. Our ideas may be applied directly to other 2-level atomic systems and different field configurations. We hope that these ideas will stimulate experimental work in this direction.","created":"1999-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":30,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"atomic physics: parity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dysprosium"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electric field: external field"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnetic field: external field"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Hamiltonian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":16,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Gasenzer, T.","Nachtmann, O."]}

In this truncation two types of pseudoscalar states (massless pions and massive Pi'-mesons), as well as a scalar, vector and axial-vector one arise as a consequence of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.

{"title":"Derivation of the effective chiral Lagrangian for pseudoscalar mesons from QCD","abstract":"We formally derive the chiral Lagrangian for low lying pseudoscalar mesons from the first principles of QCD considering the contributions from the normal part of the theory without taking approximations. The derivation is based on the standard generating functional of QCD in the path integral formalism. The gluon-field integration is formally carried out by expressing the result in terms of physical Green's functions of the gluon. To integrate over the quark-field, we introduce a bilocal auxiliary field Phi(x,y) representing the mesons. We then develop a consistent way of extracting the local pseudoscalar degree of freedom U(x) in Phi(x,y) and integrating out the rest degrees of freedom such that the complete pseudoscalar degree of freedom resides in U(x). With certain techniques, we work out the explicit U(x)-dependence of the effective action up to the p^4-terms in the momentum expansion, which leads to the desired chiral Lagrangian in which all the coefficients contributed from the normal part of the theory are expressed in terms of certain Green's functions in QCD. Together with the existing QCD formulae for the anomaly contributions, the present results leads to the complete QCD definition of the coefficients in the chiral Lagrangian. The relation between the present QCD definition of the p^2-order coefficient F_0^2 and the well-known approximate result given by Pagels and Stokar is discussed.","created":"1999-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":26,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pseudoscalar meson"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"functional analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n-point function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion: momentum"}],"num_refs":34,"citation_count":41,"authors":["Wang, Qing","Kuang, Yu-Ping","Xiao, Ming","Wang, Xue-Lei"]}

We find that in this limit all the effects produced by the supersymmetric particles can be, either absorbed in the Standard Model parameters and gauge bosons wave functions, or else they are supressed by inverse powers of the supersymmetric particle masses. This work, therefore, completes the proof of decoupling of the heavy supersymmetric particles from the standard ones in the electroweak bosons effective action and in the sense of the Appelquist-Carazzone Theorem that we started in a previous work.

The model describes the meson mass spectrum, and comparison with measured meson masses allows one to determine the parameters of the model: current quark masses, universal string tension, and phenomenological constants describing nonstring short-range interaction. The meson Regge trajectories are in general nonlinear; practically linear are only trajectories for light-quark mesons with non-zero lowest spins. The model predicts masses of many new higher-spin mesons. A new $K^*(1^-)$ meson is predicted with mass 1910 Mev. In some cases the masses of new low-spin mesons are predicted by extrapolation of the phenomenological short-range parameters in the quark masses. In this way the model predicts the mass of $\\eta_b(1S)(0^{-+})$ to be $9500\\pm 30$ MeV, and the mass of $B_c(0^-)$ to be $6400\\pm 30$ MeV (the potential model predictions are 100 Mev lower).

The sign and shape of the quark OAM distribution at high $Q^2$ may depend strongly on the relative size of the OAM and spin distributions at the hadronic scale.

{"title":"CP violation and beauty decays - a case study of high impact, high sensitivity and even high precision physics","abstract":"The narrative of these lectures contains three main threads: (i) CP violation despite having so far been observed only in the decays of neutral kaons has been recognized as a phenomenon of truly fundamental importance. The KM ansatz constitutes the minimal implementation of CP violation: without requiring unknown degrees of freedom it can reproduce the known CP phenomenology in a nontrivial way. (ii) The physics of beauty hadrons -- in particular their weak decays -- opens a novel window onto fundamental dynamics: they usher in a new quark family (presumably the last one); they allow us to determine fundamental quantities of the Standard Model like the $b$ quark mass and the CKM parameters $V(cb)$, $V(ub)$, $V(ts)$ and $V(td)$; they exhibit speedy or even rapid $B^0 - \\bar B^0$J oscillations. (iii) Heavy Quark Expansions allow us to treat $B$ decays with an accuracy that would not have been thought possible a mere decade ago. These three threads are joined together in the following manner: (a) Huge CP asymmetries are {\\em pre}dicted in $B$ decays, which represents a decisive test of the KM paradigm for CP violation. (b) Some of these predictions are made with high {\\em parametric} reliability, which (c) can be translated into {\\em numerical} precision through the judicious employment of novel theoretical technologies.

In this way one can achieve a simultaneous understanding of low-lying mesons, baryons and the nuclear force. The discussion is general and does not necessarily rely on the instanton-induced interaction. Any nonperturbative gluonic interaction between quarks, which is a source of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and explains the $\\pi$ - $\\rho$ mass splitting, will imply an effective meson exchange picture in baryons. Due to the (anti)screening there is a big difference between the initial 't Hooft interaction and the effective meson-exchange interaction. It is demonstrated that the effective meson-exchange interaction, adjusted to the baryon spectrum, does not bind the scalar diquark and does not induce any significant quark-diquark clustering in the nucleon because of the nontrivial role played by the Pauli principle.","created":"1999-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: diquark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: cluster"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"instanton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: screening"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear force"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Hamiltonian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":22,"citation_count":24,"authors":["Glozman, L.Ya.","Varga, K."]}

The same approach is used also for a covariant modification of the real-time Green's functions method based on the Wigner representation. The suggested approach does not contain arbitrariness' elements and uncertainties which often arise from derivation of RKE on the basis of the motion equations of the Kadanoff-Baym type for the correlation functions in the case of systems with inner degrees of freedom.

{"title":"Improved single sector supersymmetry breaking","abstract":"Building on recent work by N. Arkani-Hamed and the present authors, we construct realistic models that break supersymmetry dynamically and give rise to composite quarks and leptons, all in a single strongly-coupled sector. The most important improvement compared to earlier models is that the second-generation composite states correspond to dimension-2 \"meson\" operators in the ultraviolet. This leads to a higher scale for flavor physics, and gives a completely natural suppression of flavor-changing neutral currents. We also construct models in which the hierarchy of Yukawa couplings is explained by the dimensionality of composite states. These models provide an interesting and viable alternative to gravity- and gauge-mediated models. The generic signatures are unification of scalar masses with different quantum numbers at the compositeness scale, and lighter gaugino, Higgsino, and third-generation squark and slepton masses. We also analyze large classes of models that give rise to both compositeness and supersymmetry breaking, based on gauge theories with confining, fixed-point, or free-magnetic dynamics.","created":"1998-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":35,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: dynamically broken"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: composite"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: operator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(N)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fixed point"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":49,"citation_count":72,"authors":["Luty, Markus A.","Terning, John"]}

{"title":"Fermion masses, neutrino oscillations, and proton decay in the light of Super-Kamiokande","abstract":"Within the framework of unified gauge models, interactions responsible for neutrino masses can also provide mechanisms for nucleon instability. We discuss their implications concretely in the light of recent results on neutrino oscillation from the SuperKamiokande collaboration. We construct a predictive SO(10)-based framework that describes the masses and mixing of all quarks and leptons. An overconstrained global fit is obtained, that makes five successful predictions for quarks and charged leptons. The same description provides agreement with the SuperK results on atmospheric neutrinos and supports a small-angle MSW mechanism.

It was found that positivity and stability of the cross section was only restored at the four-loop level. One remaining large source of uncertainty stems from the fact that the scale of the strong coupling is unspecified within the double logarithmic approximation. In this paper we include the leading and next-to-leading order running coupling to all orders. We thus remove the inherent scale uncertainty of both the exact one-loop and all-orders DL result without encountering any Landau-pole singularities.

We show that for some regions of non universality in the scalar masses at the GUT scale based on unifying groups like SU(5) or SO(10), the final state mostly consists of 3$l$+${\\rlap/E}_T$ and $\\tau ll$+${\\rlap/E}_T$. The first mode has very high detection efficiency and the second one is expected to have high detection efficency as well. We also show that these models can have enough events in these modes to be detected in RUN II.","created":"1998-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SU(5)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SO(10)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supergravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"chargino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"final state: (3lepton)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"2000 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":25,"citation_count":15,"authors":["Accomando, E.","Arnowitt, Richard L.","Dutta, Bhaskar"]}

The analysis of the neutral sector has the advantage that it has relatively fewer parameters compared to the charged sector since the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements in the right-handed sector do not enter into the analysis, hence the number of various possibilities from a big parameter space is reduced. We utilize theoretical considerations on the masses of the gauge particles and the mixing angles. We combine the precision electroweak data from LEP I and the low-energy neutral-current experimental data to constrain the parameters introduced in the model. It turns out that $M_{Z^{\\prime}}> 400$ GeV, $-0.0028 <\\xi <0.0065$ with little constraint on $\\theta_R$. In the left-right symmetric theory, $M_{Z^{\\prime}}$ should be larger than 900 GeV. With these constraints, we compare the values for $\\sigma (e^+ e^- \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-)$, $\\sigma (e^+ e^- \\to b\\bar{b})$ and $A_{FB}^{\\ell}$ at LEP II with experimental values.","created":"1998-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":34,"keywords":[{"schema":"PDG","source":"PDG","value":"S056ZLR"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(2) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: validity test"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Z': mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W': mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lower limit"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: left-right"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular distribution: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino electron: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino nucleon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron nucleon: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":33,"citation_count":37,"authors":["Chay, Junegone","Lee, Kang Young","Nam, Soo-hyeon"]}

{"title":"Neutrino masses: From fantasy to facts","abstract":"Theory suggests the existence of neutrino masses, but little more. Facts are coming close to reveal our fantasy: solar and atmospheric neutrino data strongly indicate the need for neutrino conversions, while LSND provides an intriguing hint. The simplest ways to reconcile these data in terms of neutrino oscillations invoke a light sterile neutrino in addition to the three active ones. Out of the four neutrinos, two are maximally-mixed and lie at the LSND scale, while the others are at the solar mass scale. These schemes can be distinguished at neutral-current-sensitive solar & atmospheric neutrino experiments. I discuss the simplest theoretical scenarios, where the lightness of the sterile neutrino, the nearly maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing, and the generation of $\\Delta {m^2}_\\odot$ & $\\Delta {m^2}_{atm}$ all follow naturally from the assumed lepton-number symmetry and its breaking. Although the most likely interpretation of the present data is in terms of neutrino-mass-induced oscillations, one still has room for alternative explanations, such as flavour changing neutrino interactions, with no need for neutrino mass or mixing. Such flavour violating transitions arise in theories with strictly massless neutrinos, and may lead to other sizeable flavour non-conservation effects, such as $\\mu \\to e + \\gamma$, $\\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei, unaccompanied by neutrino-less double beta decay.","created":"1999-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":33,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Ioannina 1998/09/30"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass generation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Majoron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light nucleus: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":232,"citation_count":10,"authors":["Valle, J.W.F."]}

Finally, we study several differential single-inclusive heavy quark distributions and, for the polarized HERA option, the total bottom spin asymmetry.","created":"1998-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":46,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Bx"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.88.+e"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"13.85.Ni"},{"source":"author","value":"Perturbative QCD"},{"source":"author","value":"Next-to-leading order calculation"},{"source":"author","value":"Spin-dependent photoproduction"},{"source":"author","value":"Heavy quarks"},{"source":"author","value":"Polarized gluon distribution"},{"source":"author","value":"HVBM prescription"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton nucleon: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon nucleon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fusion: photon gluon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charm"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon quark: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"factorization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rapidity spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":61,"citation_count":52,"authors":["Bojak, I.","Stratmann, M."]}

{"title":"Theory of the CP Violating Parameter $\\epsilon^{\\prime} / \\epsilon$","abstract":"The real part of epsilon'/epsilon measures direct CP violation in the decays of the neutral kaons in two pions. It is a fundamental quantity which has justly attracted a great deal of theoretical as well as experimental work. Its determination may answer the question of whether CP violation is present only in the mass matrix of neutral kaons (the superweak scenario) or also at work directly in the decays. After a brief historical summary, we discuss the present and expected experimental sensitivities. In the light of these, we come to the problem of estimating epsilon'/epsilon in the standard model. We review the present (circa 1998) status of the theoretical predictions of epsilon'/epsilon. The short-distance part of the computation is now known to the next-to-leading order in QCD and QED and therefore well under control. On the other hand, the evaluation of the hadronic matrix element of the relevant operators is where most of the theoretical uncertainty still resides. We analyze the results of the currently most developed calculations. The values of the B_i parameters in the various approaches are discussed, together with the allowed range of the relevant combination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa entries Im V_{td}V^*_{ts}. We conclude by summarizing and comparing all up-to-date predictions of epsilon'/epsilon. Because of the intrinsic uncertainties of the long-distance computations, values ranging from 10^{-4} to a few times 10^{-3} can be accounted for in the standard model. Since this range covers most of the present experimental uncertainty, it is unlikely that new physics effects can be disentangled from the standard model prediction.

{"title":"Forming a single, large, DCC domain in a heavy ion collision","abstract":"We demonstrate the possibility of forming a single, large domain of disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) in a heavy-ion collision. In our scenario, rapid initial heating of the parton system provides a driving force for the chiral field, moving it away from the true vacuum and forcing it to go to the opposite point on the vacuum manifold. This converts the entire hot region into a single DCC domain. Subsequent rolling down of the chiral field to its true vacuum will then lead to emission of a large number of (approximately) coherent pions. The requirement of suppression of thermal fluctuations to maintain the (approximate) coherence of such a large DCC domain, favors three dimensional expansion of the plasma over the longitudinal expansion even at very early stages of evolution. This also constrains the maximum temperature of the system to lie within a window. We roughly estimate this window to be about 200 - 400 MeV. These results lead us to predict that extremely high energy collisions of {\\it very small nuclei} (possibly hadrons) are better suited for observing signatures of a large DCC. Another possibility is to focus on {\\it peripheral} collisions of heavy nuclei.","created":"1998-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":8,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"condensation: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sigma model: linear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature: time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":17,"citation_count":9,"authors":["Digal, Sanatan","Ray, Rajarshi","Sengupta, Supratim","Srivastava, Ajit M."]}

{"title":"Dirac magnetic monopole and the discrete symmetries","abstract":"We examine several issues related to the processes of Dirac monopole-antimonopole production in high-energy collisions such as $e^+e^-$ annihilation. Perturbative calculations for such processes are known to be inherently ambiguous due to the arbitrariness of direction of the monopole string; this requires use of some prescription to obtain physical results. We argue that different prescriptions lead to drastically different physical results which suggests that at present we do not have an entirely satisfactory procedure for the elimination of string arbitrariness (this problem is quite separate from the problems caused by the large coupling constant). We then analyze the consequencies of discrete symmetries (P and C) for the monopole production processes and for the monopole-antimonopole states. The P and C selection rules for the monopole-antimonopole states turn out to be different from those for the ordinary fermion-antifermion or boson-antiboson system. In particular, the spin 1/2 monopole and antimonopole should have the same helicities if they are produced through the one-photon annihilation of an electron and positron. A stronger selection rule holds for spinless monopoles: CP symmetry absolutely forbids the monopole-antimonopole production through the one-photon annihilation of an electron and positron. Single-photon $e^+e^- \\to g^+g^-$ amplitude has been a key input in calculating the contribution of virtual $g^+g^-$ pairs to various physical processes such as the decay $Z\\to 3\\gamma$ and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. Applying our conclusions to these cases can lead to significant modifications of the results obtained in previous works.","created":"1997-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnetic monopole: Dirac"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model: magnetic monopole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnetic monopole: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: discrete"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"selection rule: parity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"selection rule: charge conjugation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: CP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"}],"num_refs":10,"citation_count":8,"authors":["Ignatiev, A.Yu.","Joshi, Girish C."]}

Vanishing FSI with increasing $Q~2$ - the color transparency phenomenon - is shown to be very strong.","created":"1995-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi+: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadroproduction: pi+"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi0: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadroproduction: pi0"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor: pi"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"linear space: Fock space"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light cone behavior"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"final-state interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: transparency"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section: angular dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular dependence: differential cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p --> n pi+ electron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p --> p pi0 electron"}],"num_refs":36,"citation_count":11,"authors":["Speth, J.","Zoller, V.R."]}
{"title":"Signals for supersymmetry at HERA","abstract":"We consider the baryon parity signals at HERA for the case of the MSSM production mechanisms and the decays via the lepton number violating couplings $L_iQ{\\bar D}$. We can probe very small Yukawa couplings $\\lam' \\gsim 3\\cdot 10~{-6}$, limited only by the decay length of the LSP. We assume the LSP to be the lightest neutralino and study its decays in detail. We present the matrix element squared for the tree-level decay amplitude of a generally mixed neutralino explicitly. We find that the branching fraction to charged leptons strongly depends on the SUSY parameters and can differ significantly from the naively expected $50\\%$. The SUSY mass reaches of the studied processes in the ZEUS detector at HERA were found to be: $(m({\\tilde e}, {\\tilde \\nu})+m({\\tilde q}))\\leq 170\\gev$, $195\\gev$ and $205\\gev$ for the $L_\\tau Q{\\bar D}, L_\\mu Q{\\bar D}$ and $L_e Q{\\bar D}$ couplings respectively. These are well above existing limits on R-parity violating (\\rpv) SUSY from previous experiments. We conclude that HERA offers a {\\it very promising} discovery potential for \\rpv\\ SUSY.","created":"1994-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":34,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pair production: sparticle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charged current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: parity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parity: baryon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Yukawa: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: LSP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay modes: sparticle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: sparticle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"violation: R parity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: (lepton+)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse energy: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spectrum: transverse energy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: DESY HERA Stor"}],"num_refs":32,"citation_count":74,"authors":["Dreiner, Herbert K.","Morawitz, Peter"]}

The special features and conditions permitting this application are elaborated upon in some detail including the dependence of the parton model and the impulse treatment on an appropriate choice of coordinate frames and the role of the very soft or ���wee��� partons. Application of the parton model is made to the calculation of the cross section for massive lepton pair production in very high energy hadron-hadron collisions and compared with experiment. The conjectured role of light cone singularities in describing this and the other deep inelastic amplitudes is also discussed.","created":"1970-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":82,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"impulse approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron hadron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bremsstrahlung"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Drell-Yan process"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"kinematics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light cone"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling"}],"num_refs":17,"citation_count":802,"authors":["Drell, S.D.","Yan, Tung-Mow"]}
