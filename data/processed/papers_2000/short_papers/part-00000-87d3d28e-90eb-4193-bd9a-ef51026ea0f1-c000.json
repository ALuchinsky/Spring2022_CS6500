{"title":"On high Q**2 behavior of the pion form-factor for transitions gamma* gamma ---> pi0 and gamma* gamma* ---> pi0 within the nonperturbative approach","abstract":"The behavior of the transition pion form factor for processes \\gamma^*\\gamma -> \\pi^0 and \\gamma^* \\gamma^* -> \\pi^0 at large values of space-like photon momenta is estimated within the nonlocal covariant quark-pion model. It is shown that, in general, the coefficient of the leading asymptotic term depends dynamically on the ratio of the constituent quark mass and the average virtuality of quarks in the vacuum and kinematically on the ratio of photon virtualities. The kinematic dependence of the transition form factor allows us to obtain the relation between the pion light-cone distribution amplitude and the quark-pion vertex function. The dynamic dependence indicates that the transition form factor \\gamma^* \\gamma -> \\pi^0 at high momentum transfers is very sensitive to the nonlocality size of nonperturbative fluctuations in the QCD vacuum.","created":"1999-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Aw"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.38.Lg"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.40.Aq"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.10.Hi"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.10.Lm"},{"source":"author","value":"Nonperturbative calculations"},{"source":"author","value":"Pion form factors"},{"source":"author","value":"Nonlocal theories and models"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon photon: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: on-shell"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: off-shell"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi0: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi0: form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor: transition"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson quark: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonlocal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":29,"citation_count":66,"authors":["Anikin, I.V.","Dorokhov, A.E.","Tomio, Lauro"]}
{"title":"Dynamical renormalization group approach to quantum kinetics in scalar and gauge theories","abstract":"We derive quantum kinetic equations from a quantum field theory implementing a diagrammatic perturbative expansion improved by a resummation via the dynamical renormalization group. The method begins by obtaining the equation of motion of the distribution function in perturbation theory. The solution of this equation of motion reveals secular terms that grow in time, the dynamical renormalization group resums these secular terms in real time and leads directly to the quantum kinetic equation. We used this method to study the relaxation in a cool gas of pions and sigma mesons in the O(4) chiral linear sigma model. We obtain in relaxation time approximation the pion and sigma meson relaxation rates. We also find that in large momentum limit emission and absorption of massless pions result in threshold infrared divergence in sigma meson relaxation rate and lead to a crossover behavior in relaxation. We then study the relaxation of charged quasiparticles in scalar electrodynamics (SQED). While longitudinal, Debye screened photons lead to purely exponential relaxation, transverse photons, only dynamically screened by Landau damping lead to anomalous relaxation, thus leading to a crossover between two different relaxational regimes. We emphasize that infrared divergent damping rates are indicative of non-exponential relaxation and the dynamical renormalization group reveals the correct relaxation directly in real time. Finally we also show that this method provides a natural framework to interpret and resolve the issue of pinch singularities out of equilibrium and establish a direct correspondence between pinch singularities and secular terms. We argue that this method is particularly well suited to study quantum kinetics and transport in gauge theories.","created":"1999-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":42,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: Euclidean"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sigma model: linear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: O(4)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: gas"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"f0(600)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time: approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charged particle: pseudoparticle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy loss"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transport theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"singularity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":105,"citation_count":59,"authors":["Boyanovsky, D.","de Vega, H.J.","Wang, Shang-Yung"]}
{"title":"A Cosmology of the brane world","abstract":"We develop a possible cosmology for a Universe with n additional spatial dimensions of variable scale, and an associated scalar field, the radion, which is distinct from the field responsible for inflation, the inflaton. Based on a particular ansatz for the effective potential for the inflaton and radion (which may emerge in string theory), we show that the early expansion of the Universe may proceed in three stages. First, the radion becomes trapped at a value much smaller than the size of the extra dimensions today. Second, the Universe expands exponentially, but with a Planck mass smaller than its present value. Because the Planck mass during inflation is small, density fluctuations in agreement with observations can arise naturally. Third, when inflation ends, the Universe reheats, and the radion becomes free to expand once more. During the third phase the Universe is ``radiation-dominated'' and tends toward a fixed-point evolutionary model in which the radion grows but the temperature remains unchanged. Ultimately, the radion becomes trapped once again at its present value, and a short period of exponential expansion, which we identify with the electroweak phase transition, ensues. Once this epoch is over, the Universe reheats to a temperature of order the electroweak scale, and the mature Universe evolves as in standard cosmological models. We show that the present day energy density in radions can be smaller than the closure density if the second inflationary epoch lasts about 8 e-foldings or more; the present-day radion mass turns out to be small (less than or of the order of an eV, depending on parameters). We argue that although our model envisages considerable time evolution in the Planck mass, substantial spatial fluctuations in Newton's constant are not produced.","created":"1999-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":38,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":72,"citation_count":107,"authors":["Flanagan, Eanna E.","Tye, S.H.Henry","Wasserman, Ira"]}

{"title":"Distinguishing anomaly mediation from gauge mediation with a wino NLSP","abstract":"A striking consequence of supersymmetry breaking communicated purely via the superconformal anomaly is that the gaugino masses are proportional to the gauge beta functions. This result, however, is not unique to anomaly mediation. We present examples of ``generalized'' gauge-mediated models with messengers in standard model representations that give nearly identical predictions for the gaugino masses, but positive (mass)^2 for all sleptons. There are remarkable similarities between an anomaly-mediated model with a small additional universal mass added to all scalars and the gauge-mediated models with a long-lived Wino next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP), leading to only a small set of observables that provide robust distinguishing criteria. These include ratios of the heaviest to lightest selectrons, smuons, and stops. The sign of the gluino soft mass an unambiguous distinction, but requires measuring a difficult class of one-loop radiative corrections to sparticle interactions.

Effective operators induced by heavy boson exchange that allow for flavor changing neutrino scattering off quarks or electrons are related by an $SU(2)_L$ rotation to operators that induce anomalous tau decays. Since $SU(2)_L$ violation is small for New Physics at or above the weak scale, one can use the upper bounds on lepton flavor violating tau decays or on lepton universality violation to put severe, model-independent bounds on the relevant non-standard neutrino interactions. Also $Z$-induced flavor changing neutral currents, due to heavy singlet neutrinos, are too small to be relevant for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly.

This enhancement decreases with larger nadir angle, thus providing a novel way to search for $\\nu_\\tau$ appearance by measuring the angular dependence of the muons.

{"title":"Split fermions in extra dimensions and exponentially small cross-sections at future colliders","abstract":"We point out a dramatic new experimental signature for a class of theories with extra dimensions, where quarks and leptons are localized at slightly separated parallel ``walls'' whereas gauge and Higgs fields live in the bulk of the extra dimensions. The separation forbids direct local couplings between quarks and leptons, allowing for an elegant solution to the proton decay problem. We show that scattering cross sections for collisions of fermions which are separated in the extra dimensions vanish exponentially at energies high enough to probe the separation distance. This is because the separation puts a lower bound on the attainable impact parameter in the collision. We present cross sections for two body high energy scattering and estimate the power with which future colliders can probe this scenario, finding sensitivity to inverse fermion separations of order 10-70 TeV.","created":"1999-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton quark: decoupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"graviton: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"proposed experiment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":133,"authors":["Arkani-Hamed, Nima","Grossman, Yuval","Schmaltz, Martin"]}

{"title":"Effects of CP violating phases on Higgs boson production at hadron colliders in the minimal supersymmetric standard model","abstract":"If the soft Supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking masses and couplings are complex, then the associated CP-violating phases can in principle modify the known phenomenological pattern of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We investigate here their effects on Higgs boson production in the gluon-gluon fusion mode at the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), by taking into account all experimental bounds available at present. The by far most stringent ones are those derived from the measurements of the Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs) of fermions. However, it has recently been suggested that, over a sizable portion of the MSSM parameter space, cancellations among the SUSY contributions to the EDMs can take place, so that the CP-violating phases can evade those limits. We find a strong dependence of the production rates of any neutral Higgs state upon the complex masses and couplings over such parts of the MSSM parameter space.

{"title":"Reheating temperature and inflaton mass bounds from thermalization after inflation","abstract":"We consider the conditions for the decay products of perturbative inflaton decay to thermalize. The importance of considering the full spectrum of inflaton decay products in the thermalization process is emphasized. It is shown that the delay between the end of inflaton decay and thermalization allows the thermal gravitino upper bound on the reheating temperature to be raised from 10^{8} GeV to as much as 10^{12} GeV in realistic inflation models. Requiring that thermalization occurs before nucleosynthesis imposes an upper bound on the inflaton mass as a function of the reheating temperature, m_{S} < 10^{10} (T_{R}/1 GeV)^{7/9} GeV. It is also shown that even in realistic inflation models with relatively large reheating temperatures, it is non-trivial to have thermalization before the electroweak phase transition temperature. Therefore the thermal history of the Universe is very sensitive to details of the inflation model.","created":"1999-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: inflaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: inflaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"upper limit"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light nucleus: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":21,"citation_count":43,"authors":["McDonald, John"]}

Recent work suggests this may protect super-Hubble metric perturbations from resonant amplification during preheating.

The suppression is naturally absent in two classes of preheating in which either (1) the vacua of the non-inflaton fields during inflation are deformed away from the origin, or (2) the effective masses of non-inflaton fields during inflation are small but during preheating are large.

{"title":"Gravitational particle production and the moduli problem","abstract":"A theory of gravitational production of light scalar particles during and after inflation is investigated. We show that in the most interesting cases where long-wavelength fluctuations of light scalar fields can be generated during inflation, these fluctuations rather than quantum fluctuations produced after inflation give the dominant contribution to particle production. In such cases a simple analytical theory of particle production can be developed. Application of our results to the theory of quantum creation of moduli fields demonstrates that if the moduli mass is smaller than the Hubble constant then these fields are copiously produced during inflation. This gives rise to the cosmological moduli problem even if there is no homogeneous component of the classical moduli field in the universe. To avoid this version of the moduli problem it is necessary for the Hubble constant H during the last stages of inflation and/or the reheating temperature T_R after inflation to be extremely small.","created":"1999-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar particle: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: moduli"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":30,"citation_count":50,"authors":["Felder, Gary N.","Kofman, Lev","Linde, Andrei D."]}

It is known that, in this approach, the small-x limit of the leading-order gluon distribution xg(x,Q^2) is a constant characterizing the averaged local field strength in the target. Matching the next-to-leading order calculation in this semiclassical framework with the one-loop parton model result, we obtain the next-to-leading order contribution to xg(x,Q^2). It shows a ln(1/x) enhancement at small x and is sensitive to the large distance structure of the target. The final expression is a simple integral over non-Abelian eikonal factors measuring the target color field. We derive a quantitative relation between the short-distance cutoff of this integral and the scale of the gluon distribution function in the MS-bar scheme.

{"title":"QCD at theta similar to pi reexamined: Domain walls and spontaneous CP violation","abstract":"We consider QCD at Theta ~ Pi with two, one and zero light flavours Nf, using the Di Vecchia-Veneziano-Witten effective lagrangian. For Nf=2, we show that CP is spontaneously broken at Theta = Pi for finite quark mass splittings, z= Md/Mu \\not= 1. In the z-Theta plane, there is a line of first order transitions at Theta = Pi with two critical endpoints, z1* < z < z2*. We compute the tension of the domain walls relating the two CP violating vacua. For Mu=Md the tension of the family of equivalent domain walls agrees with the expression derived by Smilga from chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order. For z1* < z < z2*, z \\not= 1, there is only one domain wall and a wall-some sphaleron at Theta = Pi. At the critical points, z = z*, the domain wall fades away, CP is restored and the transition becomes of second order. For Nf = 1, CP is spontaneously broken only if the number of colours Nc is large and/or if the quark is sufficiently heavy. Taking the heavy quark limit (~ Nf= 0) provides a simple derivation of the multibranch Theta dependence of the vacuum energy of large Nc pure Yang-Mills theory.

We analyze the four dimensional effective theory by integrating out the freedom of the fifth dimension. We show that some effective couplings can be explicitly calculated. As one of our results, some effective couplings of the state localized in the ``brane'' to the higher Kaluza-Klein modes in the bulk are found to be suppressed by the width of the ``brane''. The resultant suppression factor can be quantitatively different from the one analyzed by Bando et al. using the Nambu-Goto action, while they are qualitatively the same.","created":"1999-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"compactification: S(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"}],"num_refs":24,"citation_count":44,"authors":["Hisano, Junji","Okada, Nobuchika"]}
{"title":"Nuclear medium modification of the rho0(1S) mesons and rho-prime(2S) mesons in coherent photoproduction and electroproduction: Coupled channel analysis","abstract":"We study medium modifications of the dilepton mass spectrum in coherent photo- and electroproduction of the Rho(1S)- and Rhoprim(2S)-meson resonances on nuclear targets. The analysis is performed within the coupled Rho, Rhoprim... channel formalism in which nuclear modifications derive from the off-diagonal rescatterings. We find that the effect of off-diagonal rescatterings on the shape of the dilepton mass spectrum in the Rho(1S)-meson mass region is only marginal but is very important in the Rhoprim mass region. The main off-diagonal contribution in the Rhoprim mass region comes from the sequential mechanism gamma* -> Rho -> Rhoprim(2S), which dominates the Rhoprim(2S) production for heavy nuclei. Our results show also that in the Rhoprim(2S) mass region there is a considerable effect of the interference of the Breit-Wigner tail of Rho(1S)-meson with the Rhoprim-meson.","created":"1999-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":18,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon nucleus: coherent interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron nucleus: coherent interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rho(770)0: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rho(770)0: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rho(1450)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum: dilepton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear reaction: coupled channel"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"diffraction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus: form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partial wave analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":45,"citation_count":4,"authors":["Nikolaev, Nikolai N.","Speth, J.","Zakharov, B.G."]}
{"title":"B decay CP asymmetries, discrete ambiguities and new physics","abstract":"The first measurements of CP violation in the $B$ system will likely probe $\\sin 2\\alpha$, $\\sin 2\\beta$ and $\\cos 2\\gamma$. Assuming that the CP angles $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are the interior angles of the unitarity triangle, these measurements determine the angle set $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)$ except for a twofold discrete ambiguity. If one allows for the possibility of new physics, the presence of this discrete ambiguity can make its discovery difficult: if only one of the two candidate solutions is consistent with constraints from other measurements in the $B$ and $K$ systems, one is not sure whether new physics is present or not. We review the methods used to resolve the discrete ambiguity and show that, even in the presence of new physics, they can usually be used to uncover this new physics. There are some exceptions, which we describe in detail. We systematically scan the parameter space and present examples of values of $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)$ and the new-physics parameters which correspond to all possibilities. Finally, we show that if one relaxes the assumption that the bag parameters $\\BBd$ and $\\BK$ are positive, one can no longer definitively establish the presence of new physics.","created":"1999-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CKM matrix: unitarity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: cascade decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dalitz plot"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"new interaction"}],"num_refs":34,"citation_count":35,"authors":["Kayser, Boris","London, David"]}

We discuss several refinements of these models in some detail, including the important role of off-diagonal parton distributions.","created":"1999-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Minsk 1999/06/09"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Tegernsee 1999/05/30"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon p: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"J/psi(3100)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: two-gluon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"diffraction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"duality: quark hadron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: momentum transfer"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section: transverse"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: DESY HERA Stor"}],"num_refs":26,"citation_count":8,"authors":["Teubner, Thomas"]}
{"title":"Review of speculative 'disaster scenarios' at RHIC","abstract":"We discuss speculative disaster scenarios inspired by hypothetical new fundamental processes that might occur in high energy relativistic heavy ion collisions. We estimate the parameters relevant to black hole production; we find that they are absurdly small. We show that other accelerator and (especially) cosmic ray environments have already provided far more auspicious opportunities for transition to a new vacuum state, so that existing observations provide stringent bounds. We discuss in most detail the possibility of producing a dangerous strangelet. We argue that four separate requirements are necessary for this to occur: existence of large stable strangelets, metastability of intermediate size strangelets, negative charge for strangelets along the stability line, and production of intermediate size strangelets in the heavy ion environment. We discuss both theoretical and experimental reasons why each of these appears unlikely; in particular, we know of no plausible suggestion for why the third or especially the fourth might be true. Given minimal physical assumptions the continued existence of the Moon, in the form we know it, despite billions of years of cosmic ray exposure, provides powerful empirical evidence against the possibility of dangerous strangelet production.","created":"1999-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"safety: Brookhaven RHIC Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"black hole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: strangeness"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmic radiation: primary"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics"}],"num_refs":30,"citation_count":43,"authors":["Busza, W.","Jaffe, R.L.","Sandweiss, J.","Wilczek, Frank"]}

These corrections, which are due to heavy flavors only, are compared with the existing perturbation series which is computed for massless quarks up to third order in the strong coupling constant \\alpha_s. A study of the perturbation series reveals that the large logarithms of the type ln^i Q^2/m^2 dominate the perturbation series at much larger values than those given by the usual matching conditions imposed on the \\alpha_s(\\mu). Therefore these matching conditions cannot be used to extrapolate the running coupling constant from small \\mu to very large scales like \\mu=M_Z. An alternative description of the running coupling constant in the MOM-scheme is proposed.","created":"1999-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"lepton-hadron scattering"},{"source":"author","value":"deep inelastic scattering"},{"source":"author","value":"structure functions"},{"source":"author","value":"sum rules"},{"source":"author","value":"SU(N) theory"},{"source":"author","value":"quark-quark scattering"},{"source":"author","value":"Feynman diagrams"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Coimbra 1999/09/10"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton nucleon: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: sum rule"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: charm"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strong interaction: coupling constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":14,"citation_count":5,"authors":["van Neerven, W.L."]}

Comparison between these two mechanisms are made of the total cross section, $E_T$-spectra, and mean rapidity spectra. For both mechanisms, several specific models are examined with the cuts of CDF, D\\O and representative cuts of LHC. Distinct qualitative differences are predicted by the two mechanisms for the CDF $y_+$-spectra and for the $E_T$-spectra for all three experimental cuts. The preliminary CDF and D\\O experimental data for this process are interpreted in terms of these two mechanisms. The $y_+$-spectra of the CDF data is suggestive of domination by the factorized Ingelman-Schlein mechanism, whereas the D\\O data shows no greater preference for either mechanism. An inconsistency is found amongst all the theoretical models in attempting to explain the ratio of the cross sections given by the data from these two experiments.","created":"1999-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":35,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: pomeron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: (2pomeron)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rapidity spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse energy: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: CERN LHC Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: CDF"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments: DZERO"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":63,"citation_count":18,"authors":["Berera, Arjun"]}

{"title":"Extended nonchiral quark models confronting QCD","abstract":"We discuss the low energy effective action of QCD in the quark sector. When it is built at the CSB (chiral symmetry breaking) scale by means of perturbation theory it has the structure of a generalized Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with CSB due to attractive forces in the scalar channel. We show that if the lowest scalar meson state is sufficiently lighter than the heavy pseudoscalar $\\pi'$ then QCD favors a low-energy effective theory in which higher dimensional operators (of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type) are dominated and relatively strong. A light scalar quarkonium ($m_\\sigma = 500 \\div 600$ MeV) would provide an evidence in favor to this NJL mechanism. Thus the non-chiral Quasilocal Quark Models (QQM) in the dynamical symmetry-breaking regime are considered as approximants for low-energy action of QCD. In the mean-field (large-N_c) approach the equation on critical coupling surface is derived. The mass spectrum of scalar and pseudoscalar excited states is calculated in leading-log approach which is compatible with the truncation of the QCD effective action with few higher-dimensional operators. The matching to QCD based on the Chiral Symmetry Restoration sum rules is performed and it helps to select out the relevant pattern of CSB as well as to enhance considerably the predictability of this approach.","created":"1999-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"source":"author","value":"chiral symmetries"},{"source":"author","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"source":"author","value":"meson resonances"},{"source":"author","value":"Lagrangian field theory"},{"source":"author","value":"quark models"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Coimbra 1999/09/10"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Jona-Lasinio-Nambu model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar meson: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pseudoscalar meson: mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"leading logarithm approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dynamical symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mean field approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sum rule"}],"num_refs":41,"citation_count":25,"authors":["Andrianov, Alexander A.","Andrianov, Vladimir A."]}

{"title":"Multibaryons in the Skyrme model","abstract":"Low-lying multibaryon configurations are studied within the bound state approach to the SU(3) Skyrme model. We use approximate ansaetze for the static background fields based on rational maps which have the same symmetries of the exact solutions. To determine the explicit form of the collective Hamiltonians and wave functions we only make use of these symmetries. Thus, the expressions obtained are also valid in the exact case. On the other hand, the meson bindings, inertia parameters and hyperfine splitting constants we calculate do depend on the detailed form of the ansaetze and are, therefore, approximate. Using these values we compute the low-lying spectra of multibaryons with B =< 9 and strangeness 0 and -B. With these results the stability of some multilambda configurations is discussed.","created":"1999-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"quark models"},{"source":"author","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"source":"author","value":"skyrmions"},{"source":"author","value":"solitons"},{"source":"author","value":"stability"},{"source":"author","value":"Lambda baryons"},{"source":"author","value":"strange particles"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Coimbra 1999/09/10"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Skyrme model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon number: high"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"strangeness"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bound state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background field: static"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: binding energy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hyperfine structure"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: Casimir"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"collective phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"soliton: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":40,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Scoccola, Norberto N."]}

In the case of the non-leptonic weak decays, we find that although the predicted S-wave amplitudes are in rather good agreement with the observed values, the model is not able to reproduce the empirical P-wave amplitudes.

In low energy effective theories of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), one usually talks of the chiral transition for which a well defined order parameter exists. We investigate the dissociation of pions and kaons in a medium of hot quark matter decsribed by the Nambu - Jona Lasinio (NJL) model. The decay widths of pion and kaon are found to be large but finite at temperature much higher than the critical temperature for the chiral (or deconfinement) transition, the kaon decay width being much larger. Thus pions and even kaons (with a lower density compared to pions) may coexist with quarks and gluons at such high temperatures. On the basis of such premises, we investigate the process of hadronization in quark-gluon plasma with special emphasis on whether such processes shed any light on acceptable low energy effective theories of QCD.","created":"2000-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":7,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"quark confinement"},{"source":"author","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"source":"author","value":"quark-gluon plasma"},{"source":"author","value":"quark mass"},{"source":"author","value":"meson mass"},{"source":"author","value":"temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Coimbra 1999/09/10"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"K: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Jona-Lasinio-Nambu model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark gluon: plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadronization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"entropy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":28,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Raha, Sibaji"]}

Clearly, we should aspire to be as specific as possible regarding the rate and form of such instability. I argue that not only esthetics, but also the observed precision of unification of couplings, favors an economical symmetry-breaking (Higgs) structure.

In D-term inflation models, the fluctuations of squark fields in the flat directions also give rise to isocurvature density fluctuations stored in the Affleck-Dine condensate.

{"title":"Baryons as solitons","abstract":"Chiral lagrangians as effective field theories of QCD are successfully applied to meson physics in the framework of chiral perturbation theory. Because of their nonlinear structure these lagrangians allow for static soliton solutions interpreted as baryons. Their semiclassical quantization, which provides the leading order in an 1/NC expansion with NC the number of colors, turned out to be insufficient to obtain satisfactory agreement with empirical baryon observables. However with NC=3, large corrections are expected in the next-to-leading order carried by mesonic fluctuations around the soliton background, which require renormalization to 1-loop. In contrast to chiral perturbation theory, the low-energy lagrangian proves inapt and terms with an arbitrary number of gradients may in principle contribute. Assumptions about the a priori unknown higher chiral orders are tested by the scale-dependence of the results. For example, in the simple Sine-Gordon model with 1 scalar field in 1+1 dimensions, knowledge of the low-energy behavior together with the mere existence of an underlying 1-loop renormalizable scale-independent solitonic theory is sufficient to regain the full solution. Baryonic observables calculated within that framework generally lead to better agreement with experiment except for the axial quantities. For these quantities the 1/NC expansion does not converge sufficiently fast because the current algebra mixes different NC orders.","created":"2000-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"source":"author","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"source":"author","value":"chiral symmetries"},{"source":"author","value":"quark models"},{"source":"author","value":"solitons"},{"source":"author","value":"Lagrangian field theory"},{"source":"author","value":"scaling phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Coimbra 1999/09/10"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"invariance: scaling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N: color"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Skyrme model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"soliton: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sine-Gordon model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling constant: axial"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: O(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":16,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Walliser, Hans"]}

We will present a different technique for computing various physical observables, based on using the Euclidean Green functions and their K-spin partial wave reduction. In this framework it is not necessary to discretize the continuous spectrum by introducing a finite boundary. Besides this technical advantage such an alternative computation scheme makes it possible to obtain the numerical predictions of the model in an entirely independent way. Using this formulation we perform a new self-consistent computation of the nucleon state in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We use the Pauli-Villars cutoff to define the model. Our results for the nucleon energy, the mesonic profile, and various observables essentially confirm results obtained by other groups using this regularization.

Recent experimental indications in favor of these effects are observed: 1. The correlation of the T-odd one-particle fragmentation functions found by DELPHI in Z���2-jet decay. Integrated over the fraction of longitudinal and transversal momenta, this correlation is of 1.6% order, which means order of 13% for the analyzing power. 2.

Radial excitations are described by means of simple polynomial form factors in the momentum space which are introduced into the four-quark vertices of the quark Lagrangian.

{"title":"Possible Observational Evidences of Non-baryonic (non-compact) Microlenses","abstract":"It is well-known that most reliable cosmological models need the non-baryonic dark matter existence. The very interesting possibility of the non-baryonic dark matter existence was considered recently by Gurevich et al. They proved that the non-baryonic (non-compact) objects as neutralino stars may be stable during cosmological timescales. The neutralino star radius could be about few Einstein radii. On the other hand, now we have no direct evidences of the fact that microlensing is caused by compact baryonic objects such as brown, red or cold white dwarfs. Using most precise model of a density distribution (non-singular density distribution), I discuss how it could be possible to distinguish the compact (baryonic) and non-compact (non-baryonic) microlensing using light curves, polarization curves etc, therefore, possibly to find the non-baryonic dark matter.","created":"2001-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":5,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Moscow 1999/09/20"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino: star"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"star: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation: lens"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":-1,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Zakharov, Alexander F."]}

{"title":"Effects of friction on the chiral symmetry restoration in high-energy heavy ion collisions","abstract":"We study the effects of friction on the chiral symmetry restoration which may take place temporarily in high energy heavy ion collisions. The equations of motion with friction are introduced to describe the time evolution of the chiral condensates within the framework of the linear $\\sigma$ model. Four types of friction are used to study how the result is sensitive to the choice of the friction. For the thermalization stage, the time dependent temperature is parameterized so as to simulate the result of the parton-cascade model. It is parameterized according to the one dimensional scaling hydrodynamics for the subsequent cooling stage. The time development of the condensates and the entropy production due to friction are calculated numerically. The time interval in which the chiral symmetry is restored approximately is investigated in detail for four types of friction. It is found that; (i) the maximum temperature must be high enough (not lower than 230 MeV) and the friction must be strong enough in order that the chiral symmetry restoration lasts for a long time (not shorter than 3fm/c); (ii) the ratio of time interval in which chiral symmetry is restored, to the time interval in which the temperature is higher than the critical temperature is typically 0.5 when the friction is strong enough; and (iii) the entropy due to the friction is mainly produced in the early stage of the cooling. The effect of freezeout is discussed briefly.","created":"1999-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":9,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"condensation: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sigma model: linear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parametrization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling: hydrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"entropy: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":37,"citation_count":11,"authors":["Ishihara, Masamichi","Takagi, Fujio"]}

{"title":"Nonperturbative effects in gluon radiation and photoproduction of quark pairs","abstract":"We introduce a nonperturbative interaction for light-cone fluctuations containing quarks and gluons. The $\\bar qq$ interaction squeezes the transverse size of these fluctuations in the photon and one does not need to simulate this effect via effective quark masses. The strength of this interaction is fixed by data. Data on diffractive dissociation of hadrons and photons show that the nonperturbative interaction of gluons is much stronger. We fix the parameters for the nonperturbative quark-gluon interaction by data for diffractive dissociation to large masses (triple-Pomeron regime). This allows us to predict nuclear shadowing for gluons which turns out to be not as strong as perturbative QCD predicts. We expect a delayed onset of gluon shadowing at $x \\leq 10^{-2}$ shadowing of quarks. Gluon shadowing turns out to be nearly scale invariant up to virtualities $Q^2\\sim 4 GeV^2$ due to presence of a semihard scale characterizing the strong nonperturbative interaction of gluons. We use the same concept to improve our description of gluon bremsstrahlung which is related to the distribution function for a quark-gluon fluctuation and the interaction cross section of a $\\bar qqG$ fluctuation with a nucleon. We expect the nonperturbative interaction to suppress dramatically the gluon radiation at small transverse momenta compared to perturbative calculations.","created":"1999-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":65,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon nucleus: nuclear reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: off-shell"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: wave function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: absorption"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon quark: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"diffraction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: pomeron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon nucleon: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Regge poles"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"factorization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: shadowing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: longitudinal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Schroedinger equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vertex function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"small-x"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section: transverse momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: transverse momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":88,"citation_count":187,"authors":["Kopeliovich, Boris Z.","Schafer, Andreas","Tarasov, Alexander V."]}

The bounds on the electric dipole moments (EDM's) of the electron and neutron are satisfied through cancellations occuring because of the structure of the string models. Three general classes of four-dimensional string models are considered: (i) orbifold compactifications of perturbative heterotic string theory, (ii) scenarios based on Ho\\v{r}ava-Witten theory, and (iii) Type I string models (Type IIB orientifolds). Nonuniversal phases of the gaugino mass parameters greatly facilitate the necessary cancellations among the various contributions to the EDM's/ in the overall modulus limit, the gaugino masses are universal at tree level in both the perturbative heterotic models and the Ho\\v{r}ava-Witten scenarios, which severely restricts the allowed regions of parameter space. Nonuniversal gaugino masses do arise at one-loop in the heterotic orbifold models, providing for corners of parameter space with ${\\cal O}(1)$ phases consistent with the phenomenological bounds. However, there is a possibility of nonuniversal gaugino masses at tree level in the Type I models, depending on the details of the embedding of the SM into the D- brane sectors. We find that in a minimal model with a particular embedding of the Standard Model gauge group into two D- brane sectors, viable large phase solutions can be obtained over a wide range of parameter space.","created":"1999-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":28,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"n: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gaugino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":113,"citation_count":119,"authors":["Brhlik, M.","Everett, L.L.","Kane, Gordon L.","Lykken, Joseph D."]}
{"title":"The Phenomenology of a top quark seesaw model","abstract":"The top quark seesaw mechanism offers a method for constructing a composite Higgs field without the usual difficulties that accompany traditional technicolor or topcolor theories. The focus of this article is to study the phenomenology of the new physics required by this mechanism. After establishing a set of criteria for a plausible top quark seesaw theory, we develop two models, the first of which has a heavy weak singlet fermion with hypercharge 4/3 while the second has, in addition, a heavy weak singlet hypercharge -2/3 fermion. At low energies, these theories contain one or two Higgs doublets respectively. We then derive the low energy effective Higgs potential in detail for the two-doublet theory as well as study the likely experimental signatures for both theories. A strong constraint on the one-doublet model is the measured value of the rho parameter which permits the new heavy fermion to have a mass of about 5-7 TeV, when the Higgs has a mass greater than 300 GeV. In the two-doublet model, mixing of the new heavy Y=-2/3 fermion and the b quark affects the prediction for R_b. In order to agree with the current limits on R_b, the mass of this fermion should be at least 12 TeV. The mass of the heavy Y=4/3 fermion in the two-doublet model is not as sharply constrained by experiments and can be as light as 2.5 TeV.","created":"1999-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":33,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: mass generation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: composite"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"topcolor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: Higgs"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"constraint"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"doublet: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: postulated particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"group theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":26,"citation_count":55,"authors":["Collins, Hael","Grant, Aaron K.","Georgi, Howard"]}

In this sense, color screening is favorable and should be included in numerical models. In any case, we advocate that numerical models should allow the confining forces and color screening to act on each other so as to undergo the phase transition in a natural way.

{"title":"Anomaly induced gauge unification and brane / bulk couplings in gravity localized theories","abstract":"It has recently been proposed that gravity-localized compactifications can generate the required gauge hierarchy without the need for hierarchically large extra space-time dimensions. In this paper, we show that gauge coupling unification arises naturally in such scenarios as a result of the anomaly induced by the rescaling of the wavefunctions of the brane fields. Thus, ���anomaly-induced��� gauge coupling unification can easily explain the apparent low-energy gauge couplings in gravity-localized compactifications. However, we also point out a number of phenomenological difficulties with such compactifications, including an inability to accommodate the GUT scale and the electroweak scale simultaneously. We also show that brane/bulk couplings in this scenario are generically too small to be phenomenologically relevant. Finally, we speculate on possible resolutions to these puzzles.","created":"1999-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":25,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: >4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"compactification"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"orbifold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anomaly"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"}],"num_refs":38,"citation_count":43,"authors":["Dienes, Keith R.","Dudas, Emilian","Gherghetta, Tony"]}

{"title":"New fermion mass textures from anomalous U(1) symmetries with baryon and lepton number conservation","abstract":"In this paper, we present solutions to the fermion mass hierarchy problem in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard theory augmented by an anomalous family-dependent U(1)_X symmetry. The latter is spontaneously broken by non-zero vevs of a pair of singlet fields whose magnitude is determined through the D- and F-flatness conditions of the superpotential. We derive the general solutions to the anomaly cancellation conditions and show that they allow numerous choices for the U(1)_X fermion charges which give several fermion mass textures in agreement with the observed fermion mass hierarchy and mixing. Solutions with U(1)_X fermion charge assignments are found which forbid or substantially suppress the dangerous baryon and lepton number violating operators and the lepton-higgs mixing coupling while a higgs mixing mass (\\mu-term) can be fixed at the electroweak level. We give a general classification of the fermion mass textures with respect to the sum of the doublet-higgs U(1)_X-charges and show that suppression of dimension-five operators naturally occurs for various charge assignments. We work out cases which retain a quartic term providing the left-handed neutrinos with Majorana masses in the absence of right-handed neutrino components and consistent with the experimental bounds. Although there exist solutions which naturally combine all the above features with rather natural U(1)_X charges, the suppression of the \\mu-term occurs for particular assignments.","created":"1999-09-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":32,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: texture"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anomaly"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: doublet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: charge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: left-handed"}],"num_refs":28,"citation_count":29,"authors":["Leontaris, G.K.","Rizos, J."]}

This enables us to reliably extract the important CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$ from the inclusive semileptonic decay rates. The resulting lifetime ratios $\\tau(B^0_s)/\\tau(B^0)$ and $\\tau(\\Lambda_b)/\\tau(B^0)$ are found to well agree with the experimental data.

For $B^0$ decays, all the observables are found to be consistent with the experimental data.

{"title":"Sparticle mass spectra from SO(10) grand unified models with Yukawa coupling unification","abstract":"We examine the spectrum of superparticles obtained from the minimal SO(10) grand unified model, where it is assumed the gauge symmetry breaking yields the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) as the effective theory at $M_{GUT}\\sim 2\\times 10^{16}$ GeV. In this model, unification of Yukawa couplings implies a value of $\\tan\\beta\\sim 45-55$. At such high values of $\\tan\\beta$, assuming universality of scalar masses, the usual mechanism of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking breaks down. We show that a set of weak scale sparticle masses consistent with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking can be generated by imposing non-universal GUT scale scalar masses consistent with universality within SO(10) plus extra $D$-term contributions associated with the reduction in rank of the gauge symmetry group when SO(10) spontaneously breaks to $SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)$. We comment upon the consequences of the sparticle mass spectrum for collider searches for supersymmetry. One implication of SO(10) unification is that the light bottom squark can be by far the lightest of the squarks. This motivates a dedicated search for bottom squark pair production at $p\\bar{p}$ and $e^+e^-$ colliders.","created":"1999-07-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":11,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"grand unified theory: SO(10)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Batavia TEVATRON Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CERN LEP Stor"}],"num_refs":46,"citation_count":117,"authors":["Baer, Howard","Diaz, Marco A.","Ferrandis, Javier","Tata, Xerxes"]}

{"title":"Higgs boson production at the Compton collider","abstract":"The high precision determination of the partial width $\\Gamma (H \\longrightarrow \\gamma \\gamma)$ of an intermediate mass Higgs boson is among the most important measurements at a future photon--photon collider.

In addition, running coupling corrections were included exactly to all orders by employing the renormalization group. Thus all necessary theoretical results for calculating the Higgs signal and the non-Higgs continuum background contributions to the process $\\gamma \\gamma \\longrightarrow q \\bar{q}$ are now known. We are therefore able to present for the first time precise predictions for the measurement of the partial width $\\Gamma (H \\longrightarrow \\gamma \\gamma)$ at the Compton collider ($\\gamma\\gamma$) option at a future linear $e^+e^-$ collider. The interplay between signal and background is very sensitive to the experimental cuts and the ability of the detectors to identify $b$-quarks in the final state. We investigate this in some detail using a Monte Carlo analysis, and conclude that a measurement with a 2 % statistical accuracy should be achievable.

{"title":"Color neutrality and the gluon distribution in a very large nucleus","abstract":"We improve the McLerran-Venugopalan model for the gluon distribution functions in very large nuclei by imposing the condition that the nucleons should be color neutral. We find that enforcing color neutrality cures the infrared divergences in the transverse coordinates which are present in the McLerran-Venugopalan model. Since we obtain well-defined expressions for the distribution functions, we are able to draw unambiguous conclusions about various features of the model. In particular, we show that the gluon distribution functions in the absence of quantum corrections behave as 1/x to all orders in the coupling constant. Furthermore, our distribution functions exhibit saturation at small transverse momenta. The normalization of the distribution function we obtain is not arbitrary but specified in terms of the nucleon structure. We derive a sum rule for the integral of the gluon distribution function over transverse momenta, and show that the non-Abelian contributions serve only to modify the shape of the transverse momentum distribution. We obtain a relatively simple expression for the mean value of the transverse momentum-squared. The connection between the McLerran-Venugopalan model and the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi equation is discussed quantitatively.

{"title":"The Electroweak chiral Lagrangian reanalyzed","abstract":"In this paper we reanalyze the electroweak chiral Lagrangian with particular focus on two issues related to gauge invariance. Our analysis is based on a manifestly gauge-invariant approach that we introduced recently. It deals with gauge-invariant Green's functions and provides a method to evaluate the corresponding generating functional without fixing the gauge. First we show, for the case where no fermions are included in the effective Lagrangian, that the set of low-energy constants currently used in the literature is redundant. In particular, by employing the equations of motion for the gauge fields one can choose to remove two low-energy constants which contribute to the self-energies of the gauge bosons. If fermions are included in the effective field theory analysis the situation is more involved. Even in this case, however, these contributions to the self-energies of the gauge bosons can be removed. The relation of this result to the experimentally determined values for the oblique parameters S, T, and U is discussed. In the second part of the paper we consider the matching relation between a full and an effective theory. We show how the low-energy constants of the effective Lagrangian can be determined by matching gauge-invariant Green's functions in both theories. As an application we explicitly evaluate the low-energy constants for the standard model with a heavy Higgs boson. The matching at the one-loop level and at next-to-leading order in the low-energy expansion is performed employing functional methods.","created":"1999-07-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":67,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Salam-Weinberg model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":63,"citation_count":37,"authors":["Nyffeler, Andreas","Schenk, Andreas"]}

The two-loop Yukawa effects on gauge couplings lead to an unified coupling $\\alpha_X$ around 0.2 with an unification scale M_X of 10^{16.9} GeV. Large Yukawa effects in the high energy region arrest the growth of the QCD coupling near M_X making the evolution flat.

{"title":"D term spectroscopy in realistic heterotic string models","abstract":"The emergence of free fermionic string models with solely the MSSM charged spectrum below the string scale provides further evidence to the assertion that the true string vacuum is connected to the Z_2 x Z_2 orbifold in the vicinity of the free fermionic point in the Narain moduli space. An important property of the Z_2 x Z_2 orbifold is the cyclic permutation symmetry between the three twisted sectors. If preserved in the three generations models the cyclic permutation symmetry results in a family universal anomalous U(1)_A, which is instrumental in explaining squark degeneracy, provided that the dominant component of supersymmetry breaking arises from the U(1)_A D-term. Interestingly, the contribution of the family--universal D_A-term to the squark masses may be intra-family non-universal, and may differ from the usual (universal) boundary conditions assumed in the MSSM. We contemplate how D_A--term spectroscopy may be instrumental in studying superstring models irrespective of our ignorance of the details of supersymmetry breaking. We examine the possible effect of the intra--family non--universality on the resulting SUSY spectrum and the values of the strong coupling, effective weak mixing angle and W-gauge boson mass, up to a two loop accuracy, in the two models (universal and non-universal). We find that non universality relaxes the constraint of color and charge breaking minima which appears in the universal case. In addition, it predicts a 3% smaller value of \\alpha_s due to different threshold masses obtained in the latter scenario. Finally, we present the experimentally allowed predictions of the two models in an M_0 and M_{1/2} parameter space.","created":"1999-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":27,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model: heterotic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anomaly: U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"universality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":87,"citation_count":17,"authors":["Dedes, Athanasios","Faraggi, Alon E."]}

{"title":"Improved calculations of quark distributions in hadrons: The Case of pion","abstract":"The earlier introduced method of calculation of quark distributions in hadrons, based on QCD sum rules, is improved. The imaginary part of the virtual photon forward scattering amplitude on some hadronic current is considered in the case, when initial and final virtualities of the current $p^2_1$, and $p^2_2$ are different, $p^2_1\\not= p^2_2$. The operator product expansion (OPE) in $p^2_1$, $p^2_2$ is performed. The sum rule for quark distribution is obtained using double dispersion representation of the amplitude on one side in terms of calculated in QCD OPE and on the other side in terms of physical states contributions. Double Borel transformation in $p^2_1$, $p^2_2$ is applied to the sum rule, killing background non-diagonal transition terms, which deteriorated the accuracy in previous calculations. The case of valence quark distribution in pion is considered, which was impossible to treat by the previous method. OPE up to dimension 6 operators is performed and leading order perturbative corrections are accounted. Valence $u$-quark distribution in $\\pi^+$ was found at intermediate $x$, $0.15 < x < 0.7$ and normalization point $Q^2=2 GeV^2$.

{"title":"Neutrinos from stellar collapse: Effects of flavor mixing","abstract":"We study the effect of non-vanishing masses and mixings among neutrino flavours on the detection of neutrinos from stellar collapse by a water Cerenkov detector. We consider a realistic framework in which there are three neutrino flavours whose mass squared differences and mixings are constrained by the present understanding of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. We also include the effects of high dense matter within the supernova core. We find that the number of events due to the dominant process involving electron-antineutrinos may change dramatically for some allowed mixing parameters. Furthermore, contributions from charged-current scattering off oxygen atoms in the detector can be considerably enhanced due to flavour mixing; such events have a distinct experimental signature since they are backward-peaked. Hence, mixing has a non-trivial effect on the signature of neutrinos (and antineutrinos) from stellar collapse.","created":"1999-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: particle identification"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Cherenkov counter: water"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supernova"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flux"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino nucleus: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charged current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":38,"citation_count":41,"authors":["Dutta, Gautam","Indumathi, D.","Murthy, M.V.N.","Rajasekaran, G."]}

{"title":"The Resummed rate for B ---> X(s) gamma","abstract":"In this paper we investigate the effect of the resummation of threshold logs on the rate for B -> X_s gamma. We calculate the differential rate dGamma/dE_gamma including the infinite set of terms of the form alpha_s^n log^{n+1}(1-x) and alpha_s^n log^n(1-x) in the Sudakov exponent. The resummation is potentially important since these logs turn into log(2E_{cut}/m_b), when the rate is integrated from the lower cut x=2E_{cut}/m_b to 1. The resummed rate is then convolved with models for the structure function to study whether or not the logs will be enhanced due to the fermi motion of the heavy quark. A detailed discussion of the accuracy of the calculation with and without the inclusion of the non-perturbative effects dictated by the B meson structure function is given. We also investigate the first moment with respect to (1-x), which can be used to measure \\bar\\Lambda and lambda_1. It is shown that there are some two loop corrections which are just as large as the alpha_s^2 beta_0 term, which are usually expected to dominate. We conclude that, for the present energy cut, the threshold logs do not form a dominant sub-series and therefore their resummation is unnecessary. Thus, the prospects for predicting the rate for B -> X_s gamma accurately, given the present energy cut, are promising.","created":"1999-07-19T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: strangeness"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"HQET model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator product expansion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":19,"citation_count":49,"authors":["Leibovich, Adam K.","Rothstein, I.Z."]}

It is shown that the collinear approximation gives rise to a wrong angular distribution of neutrinos, essentially in the Sub-GeV region. However, the angular smearing introduced by the experimental inability of detecting recoils in neutrino interactions with nuclei is large enough to wash out, in practice, most of the differences between 3-dimensional and 1-dimensional flux calculations.

Excluding spontaneous CP violation results in two 7 parameter models. Although both models give rise to 5 scalar particles and 2 mixing angles, the resulting phenomenology of the scalar sectors is different. If flavour changing neutral currents at tree level are to be avoided, one has, in both cases, four alternative ways of introducing the fermion couplings. In one of these models the mixing angle of the CP even sector can be chosen in such a way that the fermion couplings to the lightest scalar Higgs boson vanishes. At the same time it is possible to suppress the fermion couplings to the charged and pseudo-scalar Higgs bosons by appropriately choosing the mixing angle of the CP odd sector.

Initial beam polarizations lead to three CP--even distributions and one CP--odd distribution, which can be studied independently of the details of the neutralino decays. We find that the production cross section and the branching fractions of the leptonic neutralino decays are very sensitive to the CP phases. In addition, the production--decay spin correlations lead to several CP--even observables such as lepton invariant mass distribution, and lepton angular distribution, and one interesting T--odd (CP--odd) triple product of the initial electron momentum and two final lepton momenta, the size of which might be large enough to be measured at the high--luminosity future electron--positron collider or can play a complementary role in constraining the CP phases with the EDM constraints.","created":"1999-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":37,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: associated production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: polarized beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"helicity: scattering amplitude"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: correlation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular correlation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: electric moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: polarization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: density matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum: dilepton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: angular distribution"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"differential cross section: angular dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular distribution: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"500 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":78,"citation_count":80,"authors":["Choi, S.Y.","Song, H.S.","Song, W.Y."]}

After compactification of the extra dimensions, the resulting Yukawa couplings of the Kaluza-Klein neutrinos to the lepton doublets become naturally very suppressed by a higher-dimensional volume factor, in agreement with phenomenological observations. We show that one-loop effects induced by Kaluza-Klein neutrinos, albeit tiny individually, act cumulatively in electroweak processes, giving rise to a non-decoupling behaviour for large values of the higher-dimensional Yukawa couplings. Owing to the non-decoupling effects of Kaluza-Klein neutrinos, we can derive stronger constraints on the parameters of the theory that originate from the non-observation of flavour-violating and universality-breaking phenomena, which involve the W and Z bosons, and the e, $\\mu$ and $\\tau$ leptons.","created":"1999-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":31,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: singlet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: (lepton neutrino)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: decay modes"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"universality: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tree approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":121,"citation_count":98,"authors":["Ioannisian, Ara","Pilaftsis, Apostolos"]}

{"title":"On nonperturbative calculations in quantum electrodynamics","abstract":"A new approach to nonperturbative calculations in quantum electrodynamics is proposed. The approach is based on a regular iteration scheme for solution of Schwinger-Dyson equations for generating functional of Green functions. The approach allows one to take into account the gauge invariance conditions (Ward identities) and to perform the renormalization program. The iteration scheme can be realized in two versions. The first one (\"perturbative vacuum\") corresponds to chain summation in the diagram language. In this version in four-dimensional theory the non-physical singularity (Landau pole) arises which leads to the triviality of the renormalized theory. The second version (\"nonperturbative vacuum\") corresponds to ladder summation and permits one to make non-perturbative calculations of physical quantities in spite of the triviality problem. For chiral-symmetrical leading approximation two terms of the expansion of the first-step vertex function over photon momentum are calculated. A formula for anomalous magnetic moment is obtained. A problem of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) is considered, the calculations are performed for renormalized theory in Minkowsky space. In the strong coupling region DCSB-solutions arise. For the renormalized theory a DCSB-solution is also possible in the weak coupling region but with a subsidiary condition on the value of $\\alpha$.","created":"1999-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":30,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum electrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dyson-Schwinger equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Ward identity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vertex function"}],"num_refs":28,"citation_count":26,"authors":["Rochev, V.E."]}

This interpretation of the data is in potential conflict with the successes of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), since oscillations can result in a too large contribution of the sterile state to the energy density of the universe at the epoch of nucleosynthesis. The possibility to evade these cosmological constraints has been recently the object of some controversy. In this work we rediscuss this problem and find that the inclusion of a small mixing of the sterile state with tau neutrino can result in the generation of a large lepton asymmetry that strongly suppress the muon-sterile neutrino oscillations eliminating the possible conflict with BBN bounds. In this scheme the mass of the tau neutrino must be larger than few eV's and is compatible with cosmological bounds. Our calculation is performed using a Pauli-Boltzmann method. In this approach it is also possible to develop analytic calculations that allow physical insight in the processes considered and give support to the numerical results.","created":"1999-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":45,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/mu"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino/tau: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":45,"citation_count":56,"authors":["Di Bari, Pasquale","Lipari, Paolo","Lusignoli, Maurizio"]}

However, realistic models also predict the existence of suppressed, but non-vanishing, dimensionless supersymmetry-breaking couplings.

In particular, analytic scalar quartic couplings that break supersymmetry can lead to intermediate scale vacuum expectation values along nearly-flat directions.

For an estimation of the lepton asymmetry we adopt the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism for mass matrices of quarks and leptons. We find that all of these models are successful to produce the lepton asymmetry enough to explain the baryon number in the present universe. Here we impose low reheating temperatures such as $T_R \\lesssim 10^8$ GeV in order to suppress the abundance of gravitinos not to conflict with the big-bang nucleosynthesis. Furthermore, we find that the leptogenesis works very well even with $T_R \\simeq 10^{6}$ GeV in the SUSY hybrid or new inflation model. It is known that such a reheating temperature is low enough to suppress the abundance of gravitinos of mass $m_{3/2} \\simeq 100$ GeV--1 TeV.

These coherent interactions are identifiable by final states consisting of the two nuclei and a vector meson with a small transverse momentum. The emitters and targets can switch roles, and the two possibilities are indistinguishable, so interference may occur. Vector mesons are negative parity so the amplitudes have opposite signs. When the meson transverse wavelength is larger than the impact parameter, the interference is large and destructive. The short-lived vector mesons decay before amplitudes from the two sources can overlap, and so cannot interfere directly. However, the decay products are emitted in an entangled state, and the interference depends on observing the complete final state. The non-local wave function is an example of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.","created":"1999-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":13,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"silicon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"calcium"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electromagnetic field"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: emission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon nucleus: coherent interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"J/psi(3100)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Phi(1020)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: electromagnetic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":12,"citation_count":131,"authors":["Klein, Spencer R.","Nystrand, Joakim"]}
{"title":"Parametric resonance for complex fields","abstract":"Recently, there have been studies of parametric resonance decay of oscillating real homogeneous cosmological scalar fields, in both the narrow-band and broad-band case, primarily within the context of inflaton decay and (p)reheating. However, many realistic models of particle cosmology, such as supersymmetric ones, inherently involve complex scalar fields. In the oscillations of complex scalars, a relative phase between the oscillations in the real and imaginary components may prevent the violations of adiabaticity that have been argued to underly broad-band parametric resonance. In this paper, we give a treatment of parametric resonance for the decay of homogeneous complex scalar fields, analyzing properties of the resonance in the presence of out of phase oscillations of the real and imaginary components. For phase-invariant coupling of the driving parameter field to the decay field, and Mathieu type resonance, we give an explicit mapping from the complex resonance case to an equivalent real case with shifted resonance parameters. In addition, we consider the consequences of the complex field case as they apply to ``instant preheating,'' the explosive decay of non-convex potentials, and resonance in an expanding FRW universe. Applications of our considerations to supersymmetric cosmological models will be presented elsewhere.","created":"1999-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: resonance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Friedman model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":43,"citation_count":25,"authors":["Allahverdi, Rouzbeh","Shaw, R.H.A.David","Campbell, Bruce A."]}

{"title":"Accuracy of approximate eigenstates","abstract":"Besides perturbation theory, which requires, of course, the knowledge of the exact unperturbed solution, variational techniques represent the main tool for any investigation of the eigenvalue problem of some semibounded operator H in quantum theory. For a reasonable choice of the employed trial subspace of the domain of H, the lowest eigenvalues of H usually can be located with acceptable precision whereas the trial-subspace vectors corresponding to these eigenvalues approximate, in general, the exact eigenstates of H with much less accuracy. Accordingly, various measures for the accuracy of the approximate eigenstates derived by variational techniques are scrutinized. In particular, the matrix elements of the commutator of the operator H and (suitably chosen) different operators, with respect to degenerate approximate eigenstates of H obtained by some variational method, are proposed here as new criteria for the accuracy of variational eigenstates. These considerations are applied to that Hamiltonian the eigenvalue problem of which defines the \"spinless Salpeter equation.\" This (bound-state) wave equation may be regarded as the most straightforward relativistic generalization of the usual nonrelativistic Schroedinger formalism, and is frequently used to describe, e.g., spin-averaged mass spectra of bound states of quarks.","created":"1999-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum mechanics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Bethe-Salpeter equation: spinless"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: oscillator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy levels"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: variational"}],"num_refs":35,"citation_count":23,"authors":["Lucha, Wolfgang","Schoberl, Franz F."]}

Weak boson fusion achieves a much better signal to background ratio than inclusive H -> e mu pTmiss and is therefore the most promising search channel in the 130-200 GeV mass range.","created":"1999-06-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: fusion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W': pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W': leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"tau: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum: (2jet)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular distribution: dilepton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum: dilepton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: minijet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: transverse"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: CERN LHC Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle --> 2W"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle --> 2W'"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"14000 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":52,"citation_count":273,"authors":["Rainwater, David L.","Zeppenfeld, D."]}

{"title":"Electroweak precision measurements and collider probes of the standard model with large extra dimensions","abstract":"The elementary particles of the Standard Model may live in more than 3+1 dimensions. We study the consequences of large compactified dimensions on scattering and decay observables at high-energy colliders. Our analysis includes global fits to electroweak precision data, indirect tests at high-energy electron-positron colliders (LEP2 and NLC), and direct probes of the Kaluza-Klein resonances at hadron colliders (Tevatron and LHC). The present limits depend sensitively on the Higgs sector, both the mass of the Higgs boson and how many dimensions it feels. If the Higgs boson is trapped on a 3+1 dimensional wall with the fermions, large Higgs masses (up to 500 GeV) and relatively light Kaluza-Klein mass scales (less than 4 TeV) can provide a good fit to precision data. That is, a light Higgs boson is not necessary to fit the electroweak precision data, as it is in the Standard Model. If the Higgs boson propagates in higher dimensions, precision data prefer a light Higgs boson (less than 260 GeV), and a higher compactification scale (greater than 3.8 TeV). Future colliders can probe much larger scales. For example, a 1.5 TeV electron-positron linear collider can indirectly discover Kaluza-Klein excitations up to 31 TeV if 500 fb^-1 integrated luminosity is obtained.","created":"1999-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":29,"keywords":[{"schema":"PDG","source":"PDG","value":"S071KK"},{"schema":"PDG","source":"PDG","value":"S056KKI"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"orbifold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: validity test"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: postulated particle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":80,"citation_count":338,"authors":["Rizzo, Thomas G.","Wells, James D."]}

The combined evolution of the chemical potentials and of pseudoscalar fields (like the axial Higgs), possibly present for temperatures in the TeV range, can twist the hypercharge flux lines, producing, ultimately, hypermagnetic knots (HK). The dynamical features of the HK depend upon the various particle physics parameters of the model (pseudoscalar masses and couplings, strength of the electroweak phase transition, hyperconductivity of the plasma) and upon the magnitude of the primordial flux sitting in topologically trivial configurations of the hypermagnetic field. We study different cosmological scenarios where HK can be generated. We argue that the fermionic number sitting in HK can be released producing a seed for the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) provided the typical scale of the knot is larger than the diffusivity length scale. We derive constraints on the primordial hypermagnetic flux required by our mechanism and we provide a measure of the parity breaking by connecting the degree of knottedness of the flux lines to the BAU.

{"title":"Gauge coupling unification with extra dimensions and gravitational scale effects","abstract":"We study gauge coupling unification in the presence of extra dimensions compactified at a few TeV. Achieving unification requires a large number of gauge boson Kaluza-Klein excitations lighter than the string scale, such that the higher-dimensional gauge couplings are O(1) in string scale units. Corrections to the gauge couplings from two or more loops are about 10% or larger, hence string (or M) theory is generally expected to be strongly coupled in TeV-scale extra-dimensional scenarios. Higher-dimensional operators induced by quantum gravitational effects can shift the gauge couplings by a few percent. These effects are sufficiently large that even the minimal Standard Model, or the MSSM, allow unification at a scale in the TeV range. The strongly coupled unified theory may induce dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking.","created":"1999-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":25,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"11.25.Mj"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.10.Kt"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.60.-i"},{"source":"author","value":"12.60.���i"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"unified field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: excited state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"compactification"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum gravity: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"perturbation theory: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":58,"citation_count":51,"authors":["Cheng, Hsin-Chia","Dobrescu, Bogdan A.","Hill, Christopher T."]}

{"title":"Phenomenology of flavor mediated supersymmetry breaking","abstract":"The phenomenology of a new economical SUSY model that utilizes dynamical SUSY breaking and gauge-mediation (GM) for the generation of the sparticle spectrum and the hierarchy of fermion masses is discussed. Similarities between the communication of SUSY breaking through a messenger sector, and the generation of flavor using the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism are exploited, leading to the identification of vector-like messenger fields with FN fields, and the messenger U(1) as a flavor symmetry. An immediate consequence is that the first and second generation scalars acquire flavor-dependent masses, but do not violate FCNC bounds since their mass scale, consistent with effective SUSY, is of order 10 TeV. We define and advocate a minimal flavor-mediated model (MFMM), recently introduced in the literature, that successfully accommodates the small flavor-breaking parameters of the standard model using order one couplings and ratios of flavon field vevs. The mediation of SUSY breaking occurs via two-loop log-enhanced GM contributions, as well as several one-loop and two-loop Yukawa-mediated contributions for which we provide analytical expressions. The MFMM is parameterized by a small set of masses and couplings, with values restricted by several model constraints and experimental data. The next-to-lightest sparticle (NLSP) always has a decay length that is larger than the scale of a detector, and is either the lightest stau or the lightest neutralino. Similar to ordinary GM models, the best collider search strategies are, respectively, inclusive production of at least one highly ionizing track, or events with many taus plus missing energy. In addition, D^0 - \\bar{D}^0 mixing is also a generic low energy signal. Finally, the dynamical generation of the neutrino masses is briefly discussed.","created":"1999-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":54,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dynamical symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: messenger"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CKM matrix matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(5)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization group"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CP: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass generation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":146,"citation_count":33,"authors":["Kaplan, D.Elazzar","Kribs, Graham D."]}

We also discuss the expected flux for other heavy stable particles -- like the gluino LSP. We comment that the detection of ultra-energetic neutrinos from the sun and the earth imposes model independent constraints on the high energy cutoff, as for example in the recently entertained TeV scale Kaluza-Klein theories. We therefore propose that improved experimental resolution of the energy of the muons in neutrino detectors together with their correlation with neutrinos from the sun and the center of the earth will serve as a probe of the desert in Gravity Unified Theories.","created":"1999-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":18,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flux"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: flux"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"string model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"group theory: representation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: exotic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluino: LSP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":63,"citation_count":29,"authors":["Faraggi, Alon E.","Olive, Keith A.","Pospelov, Maxim"]}

{"title":"Radially excited scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector meson nonets in a chiral quark model","abstract":"A chiral Lagrangian containing, besides the usual meson fields, their first radial excitations is constructed. The Lagrangian is derived by bosonization of a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type quark model with separable nonlocal interactions. The nonlocality is described by form factors corresponding to 3-dimensional excited state wave functions. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is governed by the standard NJL gap equations. A simple SU(2)xSU(2) version of the model is used to demonstrate all low-energy theorems to hold valid in the chiral limit. A more realistic U(3)xU(3) model with 't Hooft interaction is constructed to describe the mass spectrum of excited scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector mesons. On the basis of global chiral symmetry, we use the same form factors for the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons. Having fixed the form factor parameters by masses of pseudoscalar mesons, we predict the mass spectrum of scalar mesons. This allows us to interpret experimentally observed scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector meson states as members of quark-antiquark nonets. It is shown that the a_0(1450), K^*_0(1430), f_0(1370), f_J(1710) scalar meson states are the first radial excitations of the ground states: a_0(980), K^*_0(960), f_0(400-1200), f_0(980). The weak decay constants F_\\pi, F_{\\pi'}, F_K, F_{K'} and the main strong decay widths of the scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector meson nonets are calculated.","created":"1999-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":57,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: hadron spectroscopy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: excited state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar meson"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pseudoscalar meson"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nonlocal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Jona-Lasinio-Nambu model: bosonization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: SU(2) x SU(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: U(3) x U(3)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"current: axial"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: decay constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":53,"citation_count":60,"authors":["Volkov, M.K.","Yudichev, V.L."]}

{"title":"Status of the MSW solutions of the solar neutrino problem","abstract":"We present an updated global analysis of two-flavor MSW solutions to the solar neutrino problem in terms of conversions of nu_e into active or sterile neutrinos. We perform a fit to the full data set corresponding to the 825-day Super-Kamiokande data sample as well as to Chlorine, GALLEX and SAGE experiments. We use all measured total event rates as well as Super-Kamiokande data on the zenith angle dependence, energy spectrum and seasonal variation of the events. For conversions into active neutrinos we find that, although the data on the total event rates favours the Small Mixing Angle (SMA) solution, once the full data set is included both SMA and Large Mixing Angle (LMA) solutions give an equivalent fit to the data. The best-fit points for the combined analysis are Delta m^2=3.6 10^{-5} eV^2 sin^2(2theta)=0.79 with chi^2_min=35.4/30 d.o.f and Delta m^2=5.1~ 10^{-6} eV^2 and sin^2(2theta)=5.5 10^{-3} with chi^2_min=37.4/30 d.o.f. In contrast with the earlier 504-day study of Bahcall-Krastev-Smirnov our results indicate that the LMA solution is not only allowed, but slightly preferred. We also show that seasonal effects, although small, may still reach 8.5 % at the best-fit LMA solution without conflict with the hints of a day-night variation (6% is due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit). For conversions into sterile neutrinos only the SMA solution is allowed with best-fit point Delta m^2=5.0 10^{-6} eV^2 and sin^2(2theta)=3. 10^{-3} and chi^2_min=40.2/30 d.o.f.

The ultrasoft amplitudes share many of the remarkable properties of the HTL's: they are gauge invariant, obey simple Ward identities, and, in the static limit, reduce to the usual Debye mass for the electric fields. However, unlike the HTL's, which correspond effectively to one-loop diagrams, the ultrasoft amplitudes resum an infinite number of diagrams of the bare perturbation theory.

{"title":"Direct and indirect searches for low mass magnetic monopoles","abstract":"Recently, there has been renewed interest in the search for low-mass magnetic monopoles. At the University of Oklahoma we are performing an experiment (Fermilab E882) using material from the old D0 and CDF detectors to set limits on the existence of Dirac monopoles of masses of the order of 500 GeV. To set such limits, estimates must be made of the production rate of such monopoles at the Tevatron collider, and of the binding strength of any such produced monopoles to matter. Here we sketch the still primitive theory of such interactions, and indicate why we believe a credible limit may still be obtained. On the other hand, there have been proposals that the classic Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian together with duality could be employed to set limits on magnetic monopoles having masses less than 1 TeV, based on virtual, rather than real processes. The D0 collaboration at Fermilab has used such a proposal to set mass limits based on the nonobservation of pairs of photons each with high transverse momentum. We critique the underlying theory, by showing that the cross section violates unitarity at the quoted limits and is unstable with respect to radiative corrections. We therefore believe that no significant limit can be obtained from the current experiments, based on virtual monopole processes.","created":"1999-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"search for: magnetic monopole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: magnetic monopole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: magnetic monopole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: eikonal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bound state: magnetic monopole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"duality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon photon: elastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":63,"citation_count":43,"authors":["Gamberg, Leonard P.","Kalbfleisch, George R.","Milton, Kimball A."]}
{"title":"Wino cold dark matter from anomaly mediated SUSY breaking","abstract":"The cosmological moduli problem is discussed in the framework of sequestered sector/anomaly-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. In this scheme, the gravitino mass (corresponding to the moduli masses) is naturally 10 $-$ 100 TeV, and hence the lifetime of the moduli fields can be shorter than $\\sim {\\rm 1~sec}$. As a result, the cosmological moduli fields should decay before big-bang nucleosynthesis starts. Furthermore, in the anomaly-mediated scenario, the lightest superparticle (LSP) is the Wino-like neutralino. Although the large annihilation cross section means the thermal relic density of the Wino LSP is too small to be the dominant component of cold dark matter (CDM), moduli decays can produce Winos in sufficient abundance to constitute CDM. If Winos are indeed the dark matter, it will be highly advantageous from the point of view of detection. If the halo density is dominated by the Wino-like LSP, the detection rate of Wino CDM in Ge detectors can be as large as $0.1 - 0.01$~event/kg/day, which is within the reach of the future CDM detection with Ge detector. Furthermore, there is a significant positron signal from pair annihilation of Winos in our galaxy which should give a spectacular signal at AMS.","created":"1999-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":20,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"LSP"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Wino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics: moduli"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: search for"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"germanium"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"galaxy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"positron: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":36,"citation_count":627,"authors":["Moroi, Takeo","Randall, Lisa"]}

{"title":"Weak matrix elements and |V(cb)| in new formulation of heavy quark effective field theory","abstract":"The heavy quark effective field theory (HQEFT) containing both effective `quark fields' and `antiquark fields' is investigated in detail. By integrating out (but not neglecting) the effective antiquark fields, we present a new formulation of effective theory which differs from the usual heavy quark effective theory (HQET) and exhibits valuable features because of the inclusion of the contributions from the antiquark fields. Matrix elements of vector and axial vector heavy quark currents between pseudoscalar and vector mesons containing a heavy quark (b or c) are then evaluated systematically up to the order of $1/m^2_Q$ and parameterized by a set of universal form factors. With a consistent normalization condition between the effective heavy hadron states, the form factors at zero recoil are related to the ground state meson masses, which enables us to estimate the values of form factors at zero recoil. In particular, the Luke's theorem comes out automatically in the new formulation of HQEFT without the need of imposing the equation of motion $iv\\cdot D Q^{+}_{v} =0$. Consequently, the differential decay rates of both $B\\to D^{\\ast}l\\nu$ and $B\\to D l\\nu$ do not receive $1/m_{Q}$ order corrections at zero recoil, which is not the case in the usual HQET. Thus we quote that the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $| V_{cb}|$ can nicely be extracted from either of these two exclusive semileptonic decays at the order of $1/m^2_Q$.

{"title":"Natural fermion mass hierarchy and new signals for the Higgs boson","abstract":"We suggest a novel approach towards resolving the fermion mass hierarchy problem within the framework of the Standard Model. It is shown that the observed masses and mixings can be explained with order one couplings using successive higher dimensional operators involving the SM Higgs doublet field. This scenario predicts flavor-dependent enhancement in the the Higgs boson coupling to the fermions (by a factor of 3 to the b-quark and \\tau and by a factor of 5 to \\mu relative to the SM). It also predicts flavor changing \\bar{t}ch^0 interaction with a strength comparable to that of \\bar{b}bh^0. This opens up a new discovery channel for the Higgs boson at the upgraded Tevatron and the LHC through t -> ch^0 or h^0 -> \\bar{t}c + \\bar{c}t. Additional tests of the framework include D^0-\\bar{D^0} mixing which is predicted to be near the current experimental limit and a host of new phenomena associated with flavor physics at the TeV scale.","created":"1999-07-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator: dimension"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: coupling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CKM matrix matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutral current: flavor changing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"anti-p p: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D0 anti-D0: mixing"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Batavia TEVATRON Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CERN LHC Coll"}],"num_refs":31,"citation_count":74,"authors":["Babu, K.S.","Nandi, S."]}

The non-vanishing fermion masses allow us to perform the phase space integrations to the very collinear limit. We therefore can calculate cross sections independent of angular cuts. Such calculations are important for background studies. Results are presented for the total and some differential cross sections for e^+ e^- -> u d-bar mu^- nu and the corresponding hard bremsstrahlung process. The latter is of particular interest for a detailed investigation of the effects of final state radiation. In principle, the process e^+ e^- -> u d-bar mu^- nu gamma is also interesting since it helps to set bounds on possible anomalous triple and quartic gauge boson couplings involving photons. The size of mass effects is illustrated by comparing the final states u d-bar mu^- nu (gamma), c s-bar mu^- nu (gamma) and u d-bar tau^- nu(gamma).","created":"1999-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":18,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"final state: (4fermion)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bremsstrahlung: correction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: emission"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: energy dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: energy spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron --> up down muon- antineutrino/mu"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron positron --> up down muon- antineutrino/mu photon"}],"num_refs":20,"citation_count":31,"authors":["Jegerlehner, Fred","Kolodziej, Karol"]}

{"title":"Double beta decay in gauge theories","abstract":"Neutrinoless double beta decay is a very important process both from the particle and nuclear physics point of view. Its observation will severely constrain the existing models and signal that the neutrinos are massive Majorana particles. From the elementary particle point of view it pops up in almost every model. In addition to the traditional mechanisms, like the neutrino mass, the admixture of right handed currents etc, it may occur due to the R-parity violating supersymmetric (SUSY) interactions. From the nuclear physics point of view it is challenging, because: 1) The relevant nuclei have complicated nuclear structure. 2) The energetically allowed transitions are exhaust a small part of all the strength. 3) One must cope with the short distance behavior of the transition operators, especially when the intermediate particles are heavy (eg in SUSY models). Thus novel effects, like the double beta decay of pions in flight between nucleons, have to be considered. 4) The intermediate momenta involved are about 100 MeV. Thus one has to take into account possible momentum dependent terms in the nucleon current. We find that, for the mass mechanism, such modifications of the nucleon current for light neutrinos reduce the nuclear matrix elements by about 25 per cent, almost regardless of the nuclear model. In the case of heavy neutrinos the effect is much larger and model dependent. Taking the above effects into account, the available nuclear matrix elements for the experimentally interesting nuclei A = 76, 82, 96, 100, 116, 128, 130, 136 and 150 and the experimental limits on the life times we have extracted new stringent limits on the average neutrino mass and on the R-parity violating coupling for various SUSY models.","created":"1999-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Tegernsee 1999/06/06"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Dubna 1999/06/28"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"double-beta decay: (0neutrino)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nuclear physics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon: current"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":96,"citation_count":13,"authors":["Vergados, J.D."]}

{"title":"Origins of the baryon spectrum","abstract":"I begin with a key problem of light and strange baryon spectroscopy which suggests a clue for our understanding of underlying dynamics. Then I discuss spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD, which implies that at low momenta there must be quasiparticles - constituent quarks with dynamical mass, which should be coupled to other quasiparticles - Goldstone bosons. Then it is natural to assume that in the low-energy regime the underlying dynamics in baryons is due to Goldstone boson exchange (GBE) between constituent quarks. Using as a prototype of the microscopical quark-gluon degrees of freedom the instanton-induced 't Hooft interaction I show why the GBE is so important. When the 't Hooft interaction is iterated in the qq t-channel it inevitably leads to a pole which corresponds to GBE. This is a typical antiscreening behavior: the interaction is represented by a bare vertex at large momenta, but it blows up at small momenta in the channel with GBE quantum numbers, explaining thus a distinguished role of the latter interaction in the low-energy regime. I show how the explicitly flavour-dependent short-range part of the GBE interaction between quarks, perhaps in combination with the vector-meson exchange interaction, solves a key problem of baryon spectroscopy and present spectra obtained in a simple analytical calculation as well as in exact semirelativistic three-body approach.","created":"1999-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":11,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Uppsala 1999/06/10"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: hadron spectroscopy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hyperon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Goldstone particle: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: instanton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scalar meson: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hyperfine structure"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spin: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"angular momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"parity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":33,"citation_count":69,"authors":["Glozman, L.Ya."]}

The study has been done considering jointly the N/D method, Chiral Symmetry and implications from large N_c QCD. The N/D method provides us with the way to unitarize the tree level amplitudes constructed in agreement with Chiral Symmetry and its breaking (explicit and spontaneous). These amplitudes are calculated making use of the lowest order Chiral Perturbation Theory (\\chiPT) Lagrangians and the exchanges of resonances compatible with Chiral Symmetry as given in. On the other hand the large N_c considerations allow us to distinguish between elementary (as elementary as the pions, for instance) and compound (meson-meson) states. Making use of this formalism one observes that the \\sigma, \\kappa and a_0(980) resonances are meson-meson states originating from the unitarization of the lowest order \\chiPT amplitudes.

{"title":"Test of physics beyond the standard model in nuclei","abstract":"The modern theories of Grand Unification (GUT) and supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of standard model (SM) suppose that the conservation laws of the SM may be violated to some small degree. The nuclei are well-suited as a laboratory to test fundamental symmetries and fundamental interactions like lepton flavor (LF) and lepton number (LN) conservation. A prominent role between experiments looking for LF and total LN violation play yet not observed processes of neutrinoless double beta decay. The GUT's and SUSY models offer a variety of mechanisms which allow this process to occur. They are based on mixing of Majorana neutrinos and/or R-parity violation hypothesis. Although the neutrinoless double beta decay has not been seen it is possible to extract from the lower limits of the lifetime upper limits for the effective electron Majorana neutrino mass, effective right handed weak interaction parameters, the effective Majoron coupling constant, R-parity violating SUSY parameters etc. In this work the limits on the LN violating parameters extracted from current neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are listed.

{"title":"Neutrino physics at the turn of the millenium","abstract":"Recent solar & atmospheric nu-data strongly indicate need for physics beyond the Standard Model. I review the ways of reconciling them in terms of 3-nu oscillations. Though not implied by data, bi-maximal nu-mixing models emerge as a possibility. SUSY with broken R-parity provides an attractive way to incorporate it, opening the possibility of testing nu-anomalies at high- energy colliders such as the LHC or at the upcoming long-baseline or nu- factory experiments. Reconciling, in addition, the LSND hint requires a fourth, light sterile neutrino, nus. The simplest are the most symmetric scenarios, in which 2 of the 4 neutrinos are maximally-mixed and lie at the LSND scale, while the others are at the solar scale. The lightness of nus, the nearly maximal atmospheric mixing, and the solar/atmospheric splittings all follow naturally from the assumed lepton-number symmetry and its breaking. These basic schemes can be distinguished at neutral-current-sensitive solar & atmospheric neutrino experiments such as SNO. However underground experiments have not yet proven neutrino masses, as there are many alternatives. For example flavour changing interactions can play an important role in the explanation of solar and contained atmospheric data and could be tested e.g through \\mu \\to e + \\gamma, \\mu-e conversion in nuclei, unaccompanied by neutrino-less double beta decay. Conversely, a short-lived numu might play a role in the explanation of the atmospheric data. Finally, in the presence of a nus, a long-lived heavy nutau could delay the time at which the matter and radiation contributions to the energy density of the Universe become equal, reducing density fluctuations on smaller scales, thus saving the standard CDM scenario, while the light nue, numu and nus would explain the solar & atmospheric data.","created":"1999-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Dubna 1999/06/28"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: solar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: cosmic radiation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: flux"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: oscillation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: beam"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: sterile"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass difference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pulsar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":201,"citation_count":13,"authors":["Valle, J.W.F."]}

Extrapolation to the pion pole of precise data should allow to obtain the value of the charged pion-nucleon coupling constant. This was classically attempted by the use of a smooth physical function, the Chew function, built from the cross section. To improve accuracy of such an extrapolation one has introduced a difference method. It consists of extrapolating the difference between the Chew function based on experimental data and that built from a model where the pion-nucleon coupling is exactly known. Here we cross-check to which precision can work this novel extrapolation method by applying it to differences between models and between data and models.

Although Jordan addressed an important problem (photon statistics) that de Broglie had not considered, his modifications may have been detrimental to the development of a composite photon theory. His obsession with obtaining Bose statistics for the composite photon made it easy for Pryce to prove his theory untenable. Pryce also indicated that forming transversely-polarized photons from neutrino-antineutrino pairs was impossible, but others have shown that this is not a problem. Following Pryce, Berezinskii has proven that any composite photon theory (using fermions) is impossible if one accepts five assumptions. Thus, any successful composite theory must show which of Berezinskii's assumptions is not valid. A method of forming composite particles based on Fermi and Yang's model will be discussed. Such composite particles have properties similar to conventional photons. However, unlike the situation with conventional photon theory, Lorentz invariance can be satisfied without the need for gauge invariance or introducing non-physical photons.","created":"2001-07-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":10,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Zacatecas 1999/06/23"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"particle physics: history"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: composite"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino antineutrino: bound state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boson: statistics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field equations: Weyl"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"}],"num_refs":14,"citation_count":2,"authors":["Perkins, Walton A."]}

{"title":"Diffraction in deep inelastic scattering","abstract":"Different theoretical methods used for the description of diffractive processes in small-x deep inelastic scattering are reviewed. The semiclassical approach, where a partonic fluctuation of the incoming virtual photon scatters off a superposition of target colour fields, is used to explain the basic physical effects. In this approach, diffraction occurs if the emerging partonic state is in a colour singlet, thus fragmenting independently of the target. Other approaches, such as the idea of the pomeron structure function and two gluon exchange calculations, are also discussed in some detail. Particular attention is paid to the close relation between the semiclassical approach and the method of diffractive parton distributions, which is linked to the relation between the target rest frame and the Breit frame point of view. While the main focus is on diffractive structure functions, basic issues in the diffractive production of mesons and of other less inclusive final states are also discussed. Models of the proton colour field, which can be converted into predictions for diffractive cross sections using the semiclassical approach, are presented. The concluding overview of recent experimental results is very brief and mainly serves to illustrate implications of the theoretical methods presented.","created":"1999-05-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":135,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"review"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton nucleon: deep inelastic scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"small-x"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"diffraction: model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: semiclassical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"kinematics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rapidity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: structure function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"approximation: eikonal"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon nucleon: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Fock space"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon quark: interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector dominance"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Regge poles"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: pomeron"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vector meson: photoproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"J/psi(3100)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"rho(770)0"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: two-gluon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Compton scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"factorization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: charm"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"jet: electroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transverse momentum: spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: dipole"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hadron: form factor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state: stochastic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: higher-twist"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gluon: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":232,"citation_count":97,"authors":["Hebecker, Arthur"]}

{"title":"Phenomenological analysis of D meson lifetimes","abstract":"The QCD-based operator-product-expansion technique is systematically applied to the study of charmed meson lifetimes. We stress that it is crucial to take into account the momentum of the spectator light quark of charmed mesons, otherwise the destructive Pauli-interference effect in $D^+$ decays will lead to a negative decay width for the $D^+$. We have applied the QCD sum rule approach to estimate the hadronic matrix elements of color-singlet and color-octet 4-quark operators relevant to nonleptonic inclusive $D$ decays. The lifetime of $D_s^+$ is found to be longer than that of $D^0$ because the latter receives a constructive $W$-exchange contribution, whereas the hadronic annihilation and leptonic contributions to the former are compensated by the Pauli interference. We obtain the lifetime ratio $\\tau(D_s^+)/\\tau(D^0)$ $\\approx 1.08\\pm 0.04$, which is larger than some earlier theoretical estimates, but still smaller than the recent measurements by CLEO and E791.","created":"1999-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D/s: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D: semileptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"operator product expansion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: sum rule"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: momentum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: spectator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"interference"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"amplitude analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: singlet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: octet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: interpretation of experiments"}],"num_refs":21,"citation_count":9,"authors":["Cheng, Hai-Yang","Yang, Kwei-Chou"]}

{"title":"Formation of color singlet gluon clusters and inelastic diffractive scattering","abstract":"This is the extensive follow-up report of a recent Letter in which the existence of self-organized criticality (SOC) in systems of interacting soft gluons is proposed, and its consequences for inelastic diffractive scattering processes are discussed. It is pointed out, that color-singlet gluon-clusters can be formed in hadrons as a consequence of SOC in systems of interacting soft gluons, and that the properties of such spatiotemporal complexities can be probed experimentally by examing inelastic diffractive scattering. Theoretical arguments and experimental evidences supporting the proposed picture are presented --- together with the result of a systematic analysis of the existing data for inelastic diffractive scattering processes performed at different incident energies, and/or by using different beam-particles. It is shown in particular that the size- and the lifetime-distributions of such gluon-clusters can be directly extracted from the data, and the obtained results exhibit universal power-law behaviors --- in accordance with the expected SOC-fingerprints. As further consequences of SOC in systems of interacting soft gluons, the $t$-dependence and the $(M_x^2/s)$-dependence of the double differential cross-sections for inelastic diffractive scattering off proton-target are discussed. Here $t$ stands for the four-momentum-transfer squared, $M_x$ for the missing mass, and $\\sqrt{s}$ for the total c.m.s. energy. It is shown, that the space-time properties of the color-singlet gluon-clusters due to SOC, discussed above, lead to simple analytical formulae for $d^2\\sigma/dt d(M_x^2/s)$ and for $d\\sigma/dt$, and that the obtained results are in good agreement with the existing data.

It is also shown that the effective mass is not influenced by the leading temperature dependence of the gauge dependent part of the effective self-energy. As a result the effective mass, which is of order $eT$, does not receive a correction of order $e^2T$ from one loop, independent of the gauge parameter.","created":"1999-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum electrodynamics: massless"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature: high"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dispersion relation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transformation: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"invariance: Lorentz"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"invariance: gauge"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature dependence"}],"num_refs":15,"citation_count":10,"authors":["Mitra, Indrajit"]}

The goal is to understand the in-medium modifications of this vertex, exploring the possibility of enhanced isospin breaking by electromagnetic effects as well as the formation of neutral pion condensates in a rapid chiral phase transition in peripheral, ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. In equilibrium the effective vertex is afflicted by infrared and collinear singularities that require hard thermal loop (HTL) and width corrections of the quark propagator. The resummed effective equilibrium vertex vanishes near the chiral transition in the chiral limit. In a strongly out of equilibrium chiral phase transition we find that the chiral condensate drastically modifies the quark propagators and the effective vertex. The ensuing dynamics for the neutral pion results in a potential enhancement of isospin breaking and the formation of $\\pi^0$ condensates. While the anomaly equation and the axial Ward identity are not modified by the medium in or out of equilibrium, the effective real-time pseudoscalar-photon vertex is sensitive to low energy physics.","created":"1999-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":42,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: heavy ion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: vertex function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vertex function: (pi 2photon)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"matter: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"isospin: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electromagnetic interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi0: condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"pi: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge boson: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Ward identity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":101,"citation_count":9,"authors":["Kumar, S.Prem","Boyanovsky, Daniel","de Vega, Hector J.","Holman, Richard"]}

We use factorized models for double distributions (DDs) f(x, alpha) in which one factor coincides with the usual (forward) parton distribution and another specifies the profile characterizing the spread of the longitudinal momentum transfer. The model DDs are used to construct skewed parton distributions (SPDs). For small skewedness, the FW parts of SPDs H(x, xi) can be obtained by averaging forward parton densities f(x- xi alpha) with the weight rho (alpha) coinciding with the profile function of the double distribution f(x, alpha) at small x. We show that if the x^n moments f_n (alpha) of DDs have the asymptotic (1-alpha^2)^{n+1} profile, then the alpha-profile of f (x,alpha) for small x is completely determined by small-x behavior of the usual parton distribution. We demonstrate that, for small xi, the model with asymptotic profiles for f_n (alpha) is equivalent to that proposed recently by Shuvaev et al., in which the Gegenbauer moments of SPDs do not depend on xi. We perform a numerical investigation of the evolution patterns of SPDs and gave interpretation of the results of these studies within the formalism of double distributions.","created":"1999-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electron nucleon: exclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"hard scattering"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Compton scattering: off-shell"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"momentum spectrum: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics: perturbation theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"factorization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"meson: exchange"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":31,"citation_count":183,"authors":["Musatov, I.V.","Radyushkin, A.V."]}

{"title":"Realistic anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking","abstract":"We consider supersymmetry breaking communicated entirely by the superconformal anomaly in supergravity. This scenario is naturally realized if supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector whose couplings to the observable sector are suppressed by more than powers of the Planck scale, as occurs if supersymmetry is broken in a parallel universe living in extra dimensions. This scenario is extremely predictive: soft supersymmetry breaking couplings are completely determined by anomalous dimensions in the effective theory at the weak scale. Gaugino and scalar masses are naturally of the same order, and flavor-changing neutral currents are automatically suppressed. The most glaring problem with this scenario is that slepton masses are negative in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We point out that this problem can be simply solved by coupling extra Higgs doublets to the leptons. Lepton flavor-changing neutral currents can be naturally avoided by approximate symmetries. We also describe more speculative solutions involving compositeness near the weak scale. We then turn to electroweak symmetry breaking. Adding an explicit \\mu term gives a value for B\\mu that is too large by a factor of order 100. We construct a realistic model in which the \\mu term arises from the vacuum expectation value of a singlet field, so all weak-scale masses are directly related to m_{3/2}.

In particular, we refer to a high-luminosity (L ~ 3 x 10^34 cm^-2 s^-1) machine, and use detailed simulation tools for a proposed detector. Among the GMSB-model building options, we define a simple framework and outline its predictions at the LC, under the assumption that no SUSY signal is detected at LEP or Tevatron. Our focus is on the case where a neutralino (N1) is the next-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP), for which we determine the relevant regions of the GMSB parameter space. Many observables are calculated and discussed, including production cross sections, NLSP decay widths, branching ratios and distributions, for dominant and rare channels. We sketch how to extract the messenger and electroweak scale model parameters from a spectrum measured via, e.g. threshold-scanning techniques. Several experimental methods to measure the NLSP mass and lifetime are proposed and simulated in detail. We show that these methods can cover most of the lifetime range allowed by perturbativity requirements and suggested by cosmology in GMSB models. Also, they are relevant for any general low-energy SUSY breaking scenario. Values of c*tau_N1 as short as 10's of microns and as long as 10's of metres can be measured with errors at the level of 10% or better after one year of LC running with high luminosity.

{"title":"Physical mechanisms generating spontaneous symmetry breaking and a hierarchy of scales","abstract":"We discuss the phase transition in 3+1 dimensional lambda Phi^4 theory from a very physical perspective. The particles of the symmetric phase (`phions') interact via a hard-core repulsion and an induced, long-range -1/r^3 attraction. If the phion mass is sufficiently small, the lowest-energy state is not the `empty' state with no phions, but is a state with a non-zero density of phions Bose-Einstein condensed in the zero-momentum mode. The condensate corresponds to the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking vacuum with <Phi> neq 0 and its excitations (phonons in atomic-physics language) correspond to Higgs particles. The phase transition happens when the phion's physical mass m is still positive: it does not wait until m^2 passes through zero and becomes negative. However, at and near the phase transition, m is much, much less than the Higgs mass M_h. This interesting physics coexists with `triviality:' all scattering amplitudes vanish in the continuum limit, but the vacuum condensate becomes infinitely dense. The ratio m/M_h, which goes to zero in the continuum limit, can be viewed as a measure of non-locality in the regularized theory. An intricate hierarchy of length scales naturally arises. We speculate about the possible implications of these ideas for gravity and inflation.","created":"1999-05-21T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":27,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"phi**n model: 4"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spontaneous symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"triviality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering amplitude"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":39,"citation_count":50,"authors":["Consoli, M.","Stevenson, Paul M."]}

In particular, we find that the upper limit on the mass of the neutralino is increased from about 200 GeV to about 600 GeV in the CMSSM, and estimate a qualitatively similar increase for gauginos in the general MSSM.","created":"1999-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":38,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sparticle: annihilation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutralino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sneutrino"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"LSP: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering amplitude: formula"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":41,"citation_count":456,"authors":["Ellis, John R.","Falk, Toby","Olive, Keith A.","Srednicki, Mark"]}

Agrawal, Barr, Donoghue and Seckel have pointed out that the Higgs mass parameter, as the only dimensionful parameter of the standard model, is of particular interest. By considering a range of values of this parameter, they showed that the Higgs vacuum expectation value must have a magnitude less than 5.0 times its observed value, in order for complex elements, and thus life, to form. In this report, we look at the effects of the Higgs mass parameter on the triple-alpha process in stars. This process, which is greatly enhanced by a resonance in Carbon-12, is responsible for virtually all of the carbon production in the universe. We find that the Higgs vacuum expectation value must have a magnitude greater than 0.90 times its observed value in order for an appreciable amount of carbon to form, thus significantly narrowing the allowed region of Agrawal et al.","created":"1999-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":9,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fundamental constant"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"helium: fusion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleus nucleus: nuclear reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"carbon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"nucleon nucleon: potential"}],"num_refs":15,"citation_count":35,"authors":["Jeltema, Tesla E.","Sher, Marc"]}

The Dirac procedure is used to eliminate the constraints in the gauge-fixed front form theory quantum action and to construct the LF Hamiltonian formulation. The physical degrees of freedom emerge naturally. The propagator of the dynamical $\\psi_+$ part of the free fermionic propagator in the LF quantized field theory is shown to be causal and not to contain instantaneous terms. Since the relevant propagators in the covariant gauge formulation are causal, rotational invariance---including the Coulomb potential in the static limit---can be recovered, avoiding the difficulties encountered in light-cone gauge. The Wick rotation may also be performed allowing the conversion of momentum space integrals into Euclidean space forms. Some explicit computations are done in quantum electrodynamics to illustrate the equivalence of front form theory with the conventional covariant formulation.

{"title":"Leptogenesis via preheating","abstract":"Leptogenesis constitues a very simple scenario to achieve the baryon asymmetry that we observe today. It requires only the presence of right handed neutrinos (which arise very naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model) and depends crucially on the mechanism responsible for their production. In particular, when their mass exceeds the inflaton mass (10^13 GeV in chaotic inflation) only non perturbative production can occur. It is shown here that non perturbative production of fermions in an expanding Universe is a very efficient mechanism up to masses of order of (10^17 - 10^18) GeV, and that it can be easily applied to solve the baryon asymmetry problem.","created":"1999-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":5,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"talk: Valencia 1999/05/03"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"cosmological model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: asymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: inflaton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effect: nonperturbative"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":12,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Peloso, Marco"]}
{"title":"Measuring |V(ub)| with B ---> D+(s)+ X(u) transitions","abstract":"We propose the determination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$ by the measurement of the spectrum of $B \\to D_s^+ X_u$, dominated by the spectator quark model mechanism $\\bar{b} \\to D_s^{(*)+} \\bar{u}$. The interest of considering $B \\to D_s^+X_u$ versus the semileptonic decay is that more than 50 % of the spectrum for $B \\to D_s^+ X_u$ occurs above the kinematical limit for $B \\to D_s^+ X_c$, while most of the spectrum $B \\to l \\nu X_u$ occurs below the $B \\to l \\nu X_c$ one. Furthermore, the measure of the hadronic mass $M_X$ is easier in the presence of an identified $D_s$ than when a $\\nu$ has been produced. As a consistency check, we point out that the rate $\\bar{b} \\to D_s^{(*)+} \\bar{c}$ (including QCD corrections that we present elsewhere) is consistent with the measured $BR (B \\to D_s^{\\pm} X)$. Although the hadronic complications may be more severe in the mode that we propose than in the semileptonic inclusive decay, the end of the spectrum in $B \\to l \\nu X_u$ is not well understood on theoretical grounds. We argue that, in our case, the excited $D_s^{**}$, decaying into $D K$, do not contribute and, if there is tagging of the $B$ meson, the other mechanisms to produce a $D_s$ of the right sign are presumably small, of $O(10^{-2})$ relative to the spectator amplitude, or can be controlled by kinematical cuts. In the absence of tagging, other hadronic backgrounds deserve careful study. We present a feasability study with the BaBar detector.","created":"1999-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":23,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"decay: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D/s+"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"up"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"CKM matrix: measurement"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"antiquark: bottom"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"antiquark: hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"antiquark: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Upsilon(10570): hadronic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"D/s+: momentum spectrum"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"proposed experiment: BaBar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"B --> D/s+ anything"}],"num_refs":35,"citation_count":13,"authors":["Aleksan, R.","Zito, M.","Le Yaouanc, A.","Oliver, L.","Pene, O.","Raynal, J.C."]}

At the LHC the invariant mass range available in gamma-gamma-interactions will be of the order of 100 GeV, i.e., in the range currently available at LEP2, but with a higher gamma-gamma-luminosity. Therefore one has there also the potential to study new physics. (Quasireal) photon-hadron (i.e., photon-nucleus) interactions can be studied as well, similar to HERA, at higher invariant masses.

It is shown how the maximal mixing between $\\nu_{\\mu}$ and $\\nu_{\\tau}$ neutrinos comes out naturally after spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The nearly two-flavor mixing scenario is resulted naturally from an approximate permutation symmetry between the two Higgs triplets. The hierarchy between the neutrino mass-squared differences, which is needed for reconciling both solar and atmospheric neutrino data, leads to an almost maximal mixing between $\\nu_{e}$ and $\\nu_{\\mu}$ neutrinos. Thus the model favors the intriguing bi-maximal mixing scenario.The three Majorana neutrino masses are allowed to be nearly degenerate and large enough to play a significant cosmological role.

In this talk I review the main points of this analysis. SUSY effects are parameterized using the mass insertion approximation formalism and differences with MSSM results are pointed out. Constraints on SUSY contributions coming from other processes ({\\it e.g.} $b\\to s \\g$) are taken into account. Chargino and gluino contributions to photon and Z-mediated decays are computed and non-perturbative corrections are considered.

{"title":"The Effect of low momentum quantum fluctuations on a coherent field structure","abstract":"In the present work the evolution of a coherent field structure of the Sine-Gordon equation under quantum fluctuations is studied. The basic equations are derived from the coherent state approximation to the functional Schr\\\"odinger equation for the field. These equations are solved asymptotically and numerically for three physical situations. The first is the study of the nonlinear mechanism responsible for the quantum stability of the soliton in the presence of low momentum fluctuations. The second considers the scattering of a wave by the Soliton. Finally the third problem considered is the collision of Solitons and the stability of a breather. It is shown that the complete integrability of the Sine-Gordon equation precludes fusion and splitting processes in this simplified model. The approximate results obtained are non-perturbative in nature, and are valid for the full nonlinear interaction in the limit of low momentum fluctuations. It is also found that these approximate results are in good agreement with full numerical solutions of the governing equations. This suggests that a similar approach could be used for the baby Skyrme model, which is not completely integrable. In this case the higher space dimensionality and the internal degrees of freedom which prevent the integrability will be responsable for fusion and splitting processes. This work provides a starting point in the numerical solution of the full quantum problem of the interaction of the field with a fluctuation.","created":"1999-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":24,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"sine-Gordon equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Skyrme model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coherent state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Skyrmion: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantization: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scattering: meson Skyrmion"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field equations: nonlinear"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":25,"citation_count":0,"authors":["Cruz-Pacheco, G.","Minzoni, A.","Padilla, P.","Corichi, A.","Rosenbaum, M.","Ryan, M.P.","Smyth, N.F."]}

We stress that whenever the inclusive 2-photon signature is substantially reduced, associated production, $Wh$ and $t\\bar t h$, with the subsequent decay of the Higgs into photons is enhanced and becomes an even more important discovery channel. We also point out that these reductions in the inclusive channel do not occur for the smallest Higgs mass where the significance is known to be lowest. We show that in such scenarios the Higgs can be produced in the decay of the heaviest stop. For not too heavy masses of the pseudo-scalar Higgs where the inclusive channel is even further reduced, we show that large stop mixing also allows the production of the pseudo-scalar Higgs through stop decays. These large mixing scenarios therefore offer much better prospects than previously thought. As a by-product we have recalculated stop1-stop1-h production at the LHC and give a first evaluation of stop1-stop1-Z.","created":"1999-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":48,"keywords":[{"schema":"PACS","value":"12.60.Jv"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.80.Cp"},{"schema":"PACS","value":"14.80.Ly"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: hadroproduction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"W: associated production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"top"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"photon: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: pseudoscalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: mixing angle"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"squark: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: branching ratio"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: squark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations: CERN LHC Coll"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"14000 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":87,"citation_count":45,"authors":["Belanger, G.","Boudjema, F.","Sridhar, K."]}

In the vacuum, these interactions lead to chiral symmetry breaking and generate constituent quark masses on the order of 300-400 MeV. The observation that the same forces also provide attraction in the scalar diquark channel leads to the prediction that cold quark matter is a color superconductor, with gaps as large as $\\sim$~100 MeV. We provide a systematic treatment of color superconductivity in the instanton model. We show that the structure of the superconductor depends on the number of flavors. In the case of two flavors, we verify the standard scenario and provide an improved calculation of the mass gap. For three flavors, we show that the ground state is color-flavor locked and calculate the chiral condensate in the high density phase. We show that as a function of the strange quark mass, there is a sharp transition between the two phases. Finally, we go beyond the mean field approximation and investigate the role of instanton-anti-instanton molecules, which -- besides superconducting gap formation -- provide a competitive mechanism for chiral restoration at finite density.","created":"1999-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":43,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"partition function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color: superconductivity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: gap"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 3"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"molecule: instanton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: diquark"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"random phase approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"form factor: instanton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: chemical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry breaking: flavor"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"statistical mechanics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"liquid"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"thermodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":59,"citation_count":287,"authors":["Rapp, R.","Sch��fer, Thomas","Shuryak, Edward V.","Velkovsky, M."]}

Moreover a new state of matter, quark matter, in which the ultimate constituents of matter move freely, is within the reach of present accelerators or those under construction. The confirmation of the existence of this new state is intimately linked with the determination of its space-time properties. Furthermore BEC provides information about quantum coherence which lies at the basis of the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation seen in many chapters of physics. Coherence and the associated classical fields are essential ingredients in modern theories of particle physics including the standard model.

In the process we correct some computational errors of hep-ph/9709432 and present the corrected evolution equations which have a somewhat simpler appearance.","created":"1999-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum chromodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"path integral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation function: ((n)gluon)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"color"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"charge: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: vector"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"small-x"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: tadpole"}],"num_refs":24,"citation_count":164,"authors":["Kovner, Alex","Milhano, J.Guilherme"]}

In this paper, a general subtraction formalism is presented that removes such singularities from the integrand of the numerical integration and adds back the analytically integrated contributions that have been subtracted.

The presented formalism allows for arbitrary mass and helicity configurations in processes with charged fermions and any other neutral particles. Particular attention is paid to the limit of small fermion masses, in which collinear singularities cause potentially large corrections.

Phase transitions of first and second orders and a lot of tricritical points have been shown to exist in phase diagrams.

In the massive case we have found an oscillating behaviour not only for thermodynamical quantities, but also for a dynamical quantity as the quark mass. Besides, in this case we have non-standard, i.e. non-periodic, magnetic oscillations, since the frequency of oscillations is an $H$-dependent quantity.","created":"1999-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":30,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quark: matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"four-fermion interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Jona-Lasinio-Nambu model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 1"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"flavor: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"magnetic field: external field"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: chemical"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"oscillation: magnetic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"vacuum state"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"quantum electrodynamics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":70,"citation_count":184,"authors":["Ebert, D.","Klimenko, K.G.","Vdovichenko, M.A.","Vshivtsev, A.S."]}

{"title":"Higgs physics at a gamma gamma collider","abstract":"High precision measurements of electroweak observables at $e^\\pm$ colliders indicate the existence of a light Higgs boson below the $W^\\pm$ threshold. If such a fundamental scalar should be found in the near future it is important to fully investigate the electroweak symmetry braking sector of the Standard Model. This is particularly important for an intermediate mass Higgs as its existence might indicate physics beyond the Standard Model, for instance in form of its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM). In this work we present first results on the expected precision of the partial $\\Gamma (H \\longrightarrow \\gamma \\gamma)$ width at the $\\gamma \\gamma$ option of a future linear collider. This quantity is sensitive to new physics as heavy particles do not decouple in general and differences between the SM and MSSM predictions can differ by up to 10% even in the decoupling limit of large pseudoscalar Higgs masses. This regime is difficult and for some values of $\\tan \\beta$ impossible to cover at the LHC.

{"title":"Cosmological challenges in theories with extra dimensions and remarks on the horizon problem","abstract":"We consider the cosmology that results if our observable universe is a 3-brane in a higher dimensional universe. In particular, we focus on the case where our 3-brane is located at the $Z_2$ symmetry fixed plane of a $Z_2$ symmetric five-dimensional spacetime, as in the Ho\\v{r}ava-Witten model compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. As our first result, we find that there can be substantial modifications to the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology; as a consequence, a large class of such models is observationally inconsistent. In particular, any relationship between the Hubble constant and the energy density on our brane is possible, including (but not only) FRW. Generically, due to the existence of the bulk and the boundary conditions on the orbifold fixed plane, the relationship is not FRW, and hence cosmological constraints coming from big bang nucleosynthesis, structure formation, and the age of the universe difficult to satisfy. We do wish to point out, however, that some specific choices for the bulk stress-energy tensor components do reproduce normal FRW cosmology on our brane, and we have constructed an explicit example. As our second result, for a broad class of models, we find a somewhat surprising fact: the stabilization of the radius of the extra dimension and hence the four dimensional Planck mass requires unrealistic fine-tuning of the equation of state on our 3-brane. In the last third of the paper, we make remarks about causality and the horizon problem that apply to {\\it any} theory in which the volume of the extra dimension determines the four-dimensional gravitational coupling. We point out that some of the assumptions that lead to the usual inflationary requirements are modified.","created":"1999-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":14,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Friedman model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"horizon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: Robertson-Walker"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: 5"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"orbifold"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"symmetry: Z(2)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"boundary condition"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"causality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"light nucleus: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"}],"num_refs":27,"citation_count":177,"authors":["Chung, Daniel J.H.","Freese, Katherine"]}

{"title":"Rapid asymmetric inflation and early cosmology in theories with submillimeter dimensions","abstract":"It was recently pointed out that the fundamental Planck mass could be close to the TeV scale with the observed weakness of gravity at long distances being due the existence of new sub-millimeter spatial dimensions. In this picture the standard model fields are localized to a $(3+1)$-dimensional wall or ``3-brane''. We show that in such theories there exist attractive models of inflation that occur while the size of the new dimensions are still small. We show that it is easy to produce the required number of efoldings, and further that the density perturbations $\\delta\\rho/\\rho$ as measured by COBE can be easily reproduced, both in overall magnitude and in their approximately scale-invariant spectrum. In the minimal approach, the inflaton field is just the moduli describing the size of the internal dimensions, the role of the inflationary potential being played by the stabilizing potential of the internal space. We show that under quite general conditions, the inflationary era is followed by an epoch of contraction of our world on the brane, while the internal dimensions slowly expand to their stabilization radius. We find a set of exact solutions which describe this behavior, generalizing the well-known Kasner solutions. During this phase, the production of bulk gravitons remains suppressed. The period of contraction is terminated by the blue-shifting of Hawking radiation left on our wall at the end of the inflationary de Sitter phase. The temperature to which this is reheated is consistent with the normalcy bounds. We give a precise definition of the radion moduli problem.","created":"1999-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":49,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density: perturbation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"membrane model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"potential: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"radiation: Hawking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"graviton: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":55,"citation_count":220,"authors":["Arkani-Hamed, Nima","Dimopoulos, Savas","Kaloper, Nemanja","March-Russell, John"]}

An helicity projection method is used to evaluate exactly the tree-level amplitudes of the contributing parton subprocesses ($2\\to 4$), which allows to take into account all exchange diagrams and occurring interferences. Numerical estimates of the corresponding signal cross-section that implement kinematical cuts needed to suppress the Standard Model background, are presented which show that in some regions of the parameter space the total number of LSD events is well above the background. Assuming non-observation of the LSD signal it is found that LHC would exclude a composite Majorana neutrino up to 850 GeV (if one requires 10 events for discovery). The sensitivity of LHC experiments to the parameter space is then compared to that of the next generation of neutrinoless double beta decay ($\\beta\\beta_{0\\nu}$) experiment, GENIUS, and it is shown that they will provide constraints of the same order of magnitude and will play a complementary role.","created":"1999-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":31,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p: inclusive reaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"exchange: (2W+)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fusion: W W"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton+: pair production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lepton number: violation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: composite"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Majorana"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"double-beta decay: (0neutrino)"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"model: parton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"helicity: amplitude analysis"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"channel cross section: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p p --> 2jet 2antilepton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"14000 GeV-cms"}],"num_refs":45,"citation_count":22,"authors":["Panella, O.","Carimalo, C.","Srivastava, Y.N."]}
{"title":"Fast evaluation of Feynman diagrams","abstract":"We develop a new representation for the integrals associated with Feynman diagrams. This leads directly to a novel method for the numerical evaluation of these integrals, which avoids the use of Monte Carlo techniques. Our approach is based on based on the theory of generalized sinc ($\\sin(x)/x$) functions, from which we derive an approximation to the propagator that is expressed as an infinite sum. When the propagators in the Feynman integrals are replaced with the approximate form all integrals over internal momenta and vertices are converted into Gaussians, which can be evaluated analytically. Performing the Gaussians yields a multi-dimensional infinite sum which approximates the corresponding Feynman integral. The difference between the exact result and this approximation is set by an adjustable parameter, and can be made arbitrarily small. We discuss the extraction of regularization independent quantities and demonstrate, both in theory and practice, that these sums can be evaluated quickly, even for third or fourth order diagrams. Lastly, we survey strategies for numerically evaluating the multi-dimensional sums. We illustrate the method with specific examples, including the the second order sunset diagram from quartic scalar field theory, and several higher-order diagrams. In this initial paper we focus upon scalar field theories in Euclidean spacetime, but expect that this approach can be generalized to fields with spin.","created":"1999-03-05T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":16,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mathematical methods"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical methods"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"space-time: Euclidean"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator: approximation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":12,"citation_count":13,"authors":["Easther, Richard","Guralnik, Gerald","Hahn, Stephen"]}

We start with the formulation of quantum field theory in terms of the Schwinger - Dyson equations for the correlation functions, which we describe by a closed-time-path master ($n = \\infty PI$) effective action. When the hierarchy is truncated, one obtains the ordinary closed-system of correlation functions up to a certain order, and from the nPI effective action, a set of time-reversal invariant equations of motion. But when the effect of the higher order correlation functions is included (through e.g., causal factorization-- molecular chaos -- conditions, which we call 'slaving'), in the form of a correlation noise, the dynamics of the lower order correlations shows dissipative features, as familiar in the field-theory version of Boltzmann equation. We show that fluctuation-dissipation relations exist for such effectively open systems, and use them to show that such a stochastic term, which explicitly introduces quantum fluctuations on the lower order correlation functions, necessarily accompanies the dissipative term, thus leading to a Boltzmann-Langevin equation which depicts both the dissipative and stochastic dynamics of correlation functions in quantum field theory.","created":"1999-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":30,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation function"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fluctuation: effect"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"statistical mechanics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dyson-Schwinger equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Boltzmann equation: stochastic"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Langevin equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective action"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"background field"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":86,"citation_count":76,"authors":["Calzetta, Esteban","Hu, B.L."]}

This results in a different pattern of sparticle masses and mixing angles from what is expected in the minimal supergravity model (mSUGRA) with universal GUT scale gaugino masses. We find that the resulting signal cross sections, and hence the reach of the Tevatron, are sensitive to the gaugino masses at the GUT scale. In the 24 model, the large splitting amongst the two lightest neutralinos leads to SUSY events containing many isolated leptons, including events with a real leptonic Z boson plus jets plus missing energy signal which is visible over much of parameter space.

{"title":"Hierarchies without symmetries from extra dimensions","abstract":"It is commonly thought that small couplings in a low-energy theory, such as those needed for the fermion mass hierarchy or proton stability, must originate from symmetries in a high-energy theory. We show that this expectation is violated in theories where the Standard Model fields are confined to a thick wall in extra dimensions, with the fermions \"stuck\" at different points in the wall. Couplings between them are then suppressed due to the exponentially small overlaps of their wave functions. This provides a framework for understanding both the fermion mass hierarchy and proton stability without imposing symmetries, but rather in terms of higher dimensional geography. A model independent prediction of this scenario is non-universal couplings of the Standard Model fermions to the ``Kaluza-Klein'' excitations of the gauge fields. This allows a measurement of the fermion locations in the extra dimensions at the LHC or NLC if the wall thickness is close to the TeV scale.","created":"1999-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":26,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"mass: hierarchy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"p: stability"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: chiral"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: higher-dimensional"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"coupling: Yukawa"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"domain wall"}],"num_refs":29,"citation_count":791,"authors":["Arkani-Hamed, Nima","Schmaltz, Martin"]}

In this paper we will have a closer look on the effects of shadowing by employing different parametrizations for the shadowing effect for valence quarks, sea quarks and gluons. Since the cross sections at midrapidity are dominated by processes involving gluons the amount of their depletion is particularly important. We will therefore have a closer look on the results for $dN/dy$, $d\\bar{E}_T/dy$, and $T_i$ by using two different gluon shadowing ratios, differing strongly in size.

{"title":"Nonequilibrium phase transitions in condensed matter and cosmology: Spinodal decomposition, condensates and defects","abstract":"These lectures address the dynamics of phase ordering out of equilibrium in condensed matter and in quantum field theory in cosmological settings, emphasizing their similarities and differences. In condensed matter we describe the phenomenological approach based on the Time Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) description. After a general discussion of the main experimental and theoretical features of phase ordering kinetics and the description of linear (spinodal) instabilities we introduce the scaling hypothesis and show how a dynamical correlation length emerges in the large N limit in condensed matter systems. The large N approximation is a powerful tool in quantum field theory that allows the study of non-perturbative phenomena in a consistent manner. We study the exact solution to the dynamics after a quench in this limit in Minkowski space time and in radiation dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker Cosmology. There are some remarkable similarities between these very different settings such as the emergence of a scaling regime and of a dynamical correlation length at late times that describe the formation and growth of ordered regions. In quantum field theory and cosmology this length scale is constrained by causality and its growth in time is also associated with coarsening and the onset of a condensate. We provide a density matrix interpretation of the formation of defects and the classicalization of quantum fluctuations.","created":"1999-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":30,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"lectures: Les Houches 1999/02/16"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"critical phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"astrophysics"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"condensed matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Landau-Ginzburg model: time dependence"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"scaling"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correlation: length"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"expansion 1/N"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Friedman model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"defect: topological"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"causality"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"condensation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density matrix"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"defect: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":42,"citation_count":27,"authors":["Boyanovsky, D.","de Vega, H.J.","Holman, R."]}

The solution has adjustable parameters that permit observational consistency with respect to expansion e-folds and density perturbations in the full adiabatic regime, thus insuring a valid solution regime.

{"title":"Damping rates and mean free paths of soft fermion collective excitations in a hot fermion gauge scalar theory","abstract":"We study the transport coefficients, damping rates and mean free paths of soft fermion collective excitations in a hot fermion-gauge-scalar plasma with the goal of understanding the main physical mechanisms that determine transport of chirality in scenarios of non-local electroweak baryogenesis. The focus is on identifying the different transport coefficients for the different branches of soft collective excitations of the fermion spectrum. These branches correspond to collective excitations with opposite ratios of chirality to helicity and different dispersion relations. By combining results from the hard thermal loop (HTL) resummation program with a novel mechanism of fermion damping through heavy scalar decay, we obtain a robust description of the different damping rates and mean free paths for the soft collective excitations to leading order in HTL and lowest order in the Yukawa coupling. The space-time evolution of wave packets of collective excitations unambiguously reveals the respective mean free paths. We find that whereas both the gauge and scalar contribution to the damping rates are different for the different branches, the difference of mean free paths for both branches is mainly determined by the decay of the heavy scalar into a hard fermion and a soft collective excitation. We argue that these mechanisms are robust and are therefore relevant for non-local scenarios of baryogenesis either in the Standard Model or extensions thereof.","created":"1999-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":19,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"fermion: path length"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gauge field theory: abelian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"temperature: high"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"plasma"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"transport theory"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"excited state: collective phenomena"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"baryon: production"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Dirac equation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"renormalization"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":72,"citation_count":25,"authors":["Wang, Shang-Yung","Boyanovsky, D.","de Vega, H.J.","Lee, D.S.","Ng, Y.J."]}

We investigate the effective potential of $Q$ in the framework of supergravity model including the quantum corrections induced by generic (nonrenormalizable) couplings of $Q$ to the gauge and charged matter multiplets. It is argued that the K\\\"ahler potential, superpotential and gauge kinetic functions of the underlying supergravity model are required to be invariant under the variation of $Q$ with an extremely fine accuracy in order to provide a working quintessence potential. Applying these results for string or $M$-theory, we point out that the heterotic $M$-theory or Type I string axion can be a plausible candidate for quintessence if (i) it does not couple to the instanton number of gauge interactions not weaker than those of the standard model and (ii) the modulus partner ${\\rm Re}(Z)$ of the periodic quintessence axion ${\\rm Im}(Z)\\equiv {\\rm Im}(Z)+1$ has a large VEV: ${\\rm Re}(Z)\\sim \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\ln(m_{3/2}^2 M_{Planck}^2/V_Q)$.

{"title":"Extra dimensions and the muon anomalous magnetic moment","abstract":"It has been proposed recently that the scale of strong gravity can be very close to the weak scale. Dimensions of sizes anywhere from $\\sim $mm to $\\sim $TeV$^{-1}$ can be populated by bulk gravitons, vector bosons and fermions. In this paper the one-loop correction of these bulk particles to the muon magnetic moment (MMM) are investigated. In all the scenarios considered here it is found that the natural value for the MMM is $O(10^{-8}-10^{-9})$. One main result is that the contribution of each Kaluza$-$Klein graviton to the MMM is remarkably finite. The bulk graviton loop implies a limit of $\\sim 400$ GeV on the scale of strong gravity. This could be pushed up to $\\sim 1-2$ TeV, even in the case of six extra dimensions, if the BNL E821 experiment reaches an expected sensitivity of $\\sim 10^{-9}$. Limits on a bulk $B-L$ gauge boson are interesting, but still allow for forces $10^6-10^7$ times stronger than gravity at mm$^{-1}$ distances. The correction of a bulk right-handed neutrino to the MMM in one recent proposal for generating small Dirac neutrino masses is considered in the context of a two Higgs doublet model, and is found to be close to $10^{-9}$. The contributions of all these bulk particles to the MMM are (roughly) independent of both the total number of extra dimensions and the dimension of the subspace occupied by the bulk states. Finally, limits on the size of ``small'' compact dimensions gotten from the MMM and atomic parity violation are determined and compared.","created":"1999-02-11T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":17,"keywords":[{"schema":"PDG","source":"PDG","value":"S071GEX"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"muon: magnetic moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dimension: space-time"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"correction: magnetic moment"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"gravitation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"field theory: space-time"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"effective Lagrangian"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: graviton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Kaluza-Klein model"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"graviton"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"force"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: right-handed"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Higgs particle: multiplet"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"doublet: 2"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"atomic physics: parity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"}],"num_refs":36,"citation_count":117,"authors":["Graesser, M.L."]}

{"title":"Can unstable relics save pure cold dark matter?","abstract":"The standard CDM model fails to describe the power spectrum of fluctuations since it gives too much power at small scales. Among other possible improvements, it has been suggested that an agreement with observations can be achieved with the addition of a late decaying particle, through the injection of non-thermal radiation and the consequent increase of the horizon length at the equivalence time. We analyze the possibility of implementing this idea in some extensions of the electroweak standard model, discussing the cosmological and astrophysical bounds to which these schemes are subject.","created":"1999-02-18T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":22,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"dark matter"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"spectrum: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"postulated particle: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supersymmetry: symmetry breaking"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"R parity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"supergravity"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"bibliography"}],"num_refs":68,"citation_count":7,"authors":["Masiero, A.","Montanino, D.","Peloso, M."]}

The effect of this particular initial state is not washed out in the final formula, contrary to what is usually believed. Numerically, however, the effect is completely negligible, validating the use of the two point function in the vacuum state. We also point out the requirement of conventional quantum field theory during inflation, that the quantum fluctuation in a wavelength must be evaluated, at the latest, when the wavelength crosses the Hubble length, in contrast to the usual practice in the literature.","created":"1999-02-19T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"inflation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"energy: density"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"density: fluctuation"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"propagator: scalar"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"finite temperature"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Brans-Dicke model"}],"num_refs":24,"citation_count":1,"authors":["Kundu, A.","Mallik, S.","Chaudhuri, D.Rai"]}

{"title":"The Decays neutrino(H) ---> neutrino(L) gamma and neutrino(H) ---> neutrino(L) e+ e- of massive neutrinos","abstract":"If, as recently reported by the Super-Kamiokande collaboration, the neutrinos are massive, the heaviest one would not be stable and, though chargeless, could in particular decay into a lighter neutrino and a photon by quantum loop effects. The corresponding rate is computed in the standard model with massive Dirac neutrinos as a function of the neutrino masses and mixing angles. The lifetime of the decaying neutrino is estimated to be approximately 10^44 years for a mass 5 10^{-2} eV. If kinematically possible, the decay of a heavy neutrino into a lighter one plus an e+ e- pair occurs at tree level and its one-loop radiative corrections get enhanced by a large logarithm of the electron mass acting as an infrared cutoff. It then largely dominates the photonic mode by several orders of magnitude, corresponding to a lifetime approximately equal to 10^{-2} year for a mass 1.1 MeV.","created":"1999-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","number_of_pages":12,"keywords":[{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: heavy"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: Dirac"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: radiative decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: leptonic decay"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"electroweak interaction"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"Feynman graph: higher-order"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: width"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: mass"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino: lifetime"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"numerical calculations"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino --> neutrino photon"},{"schema":"INSPIRE","value":"neutrino --> positron electron neutrino"}],"num_refs":6,"citation_count":3,"authors":["Ho-Kim, Q.","Machet, B.","Pham, Xuan-Yem"]}
