Final project of CS6500 course

## abstractWordExtraction

Read in JSON files which was adapted from Aleksei's branch.
Created a new Dataframe that has the count of each word in the abstract ordered by ID of paper.
The ID is a unique number given to each paper so that the words can later be added to the paper they belong to.
